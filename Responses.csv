27,"Single Sign-on (SSO) Service The Computer Centre has released services based on Single Sign-on based authentication. CC's SSO supports Oauth2, OpenID Connect, and SAML2 based authorization. This will enable us to make our authentication process more robust, secure, and universal for all applications across IITB. "
28,"Why is it necessary?  SSO with OAuth/SAML/OpenID is very secure compared to LDAP since it offers multi-factor authentication and a fully encrypted protocol. It also has a single point of trust for the end-user, so even if one application is compromised, the security of your application is not threatened. These protocols are very widely deployed by all major companies, including Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Apple. Nowadays It is an internet standard. "
29,"In today's IT-driven world, multi-factor authentication is very much necessary. This will considerably slow down hacking activities because of compromised LDAP accounts and eventually help end-users and system administrators since most of these accounts get compromised because of simple credentials, sharing of credentials with colleagues, sharing of credentials to a malicious site, or response to a phishing email. "
30,"How do I use SSO based authentication for the application I am developing?   Anyone who wants to use SSO for the authentication, The application needs to register with CC. For more detailed information, kindly download this documentation. "
31,"What is 2-Factor Authentication, and why is it mandatory? Two-factor authentication adds a second layer of security to your online accounts. Verifying your identity using a second factor (like your phone or another mobile device) prevents anyone but you from logging in, even if they know your password. Once you've enrolled in Google/Microsoft authenticator app or SMS based OTP, you're ready to go: You'll login as usual with your username and password, and then use your device to verify that it's you. "
32,Supported methods for 2-Factor authentication Two-Factor Authentication for CC's SSO Login is designed to work with your existing devices and network connections. We support the following devices/methods:    * Time-based OTP – based on FREE apps like Google/Microsoft authenticator   * SMS text messages via a cell phone (Only for Faculty and Institute staff members)   * Passwordless authentication using IITB SSO app (For Android and iOS platform.)   * Security key / Hardware token-based (Key/token must support WebAuthn standard and FIDO2 compliant.)   * Touch ID (For mac users) based or Windows Hello based. 
33,"The Mobile apps are free and downloadable from your cell phone's app store (e.g., iTunes or Google Play). Standard data or phone charges may apply when using, SMS text, and/or passwordless authentication. To obtain a hardware token/key for your account, users are free to purchase on their own. Please make sure the token/key is compatible with FIDO2 standards. "

66,#### Mail Facilities     #####  Features of the WEBMAIL services at IITB  ![](/assets/icons/Plus.svg)  This service enables you to access your mailbox from anywhere (inside or outside IITB) via the Internet. The current access is via SQUIRRELMAIL software with some local modifications. The interface may be changed or additional ones may be supported in future subject to resource constraints at CC. The details for different user categories are shown below: 
67,"User Category| URL| Mailbox Size Limit   ---|---|---      User Category  |  URL  |  Mailbox Size Limit      ---|---|---   All | <https://webmail-sso.iitb.ac.in>   <https://webmail.iitb.ac.in> | {Specific to user role (student,faculty etc) }         The mailbox space limit shown above may change either way depending on resource availability. Your current diskspace occupation level is always displayed when you login. Please take care to purge unwanted messages from time to time. The actual disk space usage will depend on the type of messages you exchange but a thumb rule would be not to exceed the occupation level of 75% so that your incoming mails are not interrupted. Please note that currently no facility exists at CC to take backups of users' mailboxes. This means that the mails deleted will not be possible to recover. Users may please make alternate arrangements to keep backups of their important messages. "
68,"Printing of emails is not supported. However, the mails can be downloaded to your local PC for printing elsewhere.  The webmail service provides the choice of either normal HTTP logins or secure logins by using SSL. It uses the same password as the netmon proxy authentication password. It may so happen that those of you who get locked out (for whatever reasons) at netmon proxy may also face problems in email too. "
69,"For those who do not use netmon proxy, a separate password would have to be assigned. Eventually all users in IITB will be automatically registered in the LDAP database even if they do not use the NETMON PROXY services for web browsing. "

72,"Mails arriving from a domain (e.g. sony.com) are checked to verify to see if they really originated from that domain. Under the SPF scheme, each domain enumerates the IP addresses though which all mails from that domain will be injected into the Internet. When the mails arrive at our mail relays, the arriving IPs are checked against the domain-designated IPs thus verifying its authenticity. "
73,"SPF deployment now a preferred way of handling incoming Emails. The deployment of this scheme have ensured very low-level of SPAM because many SPAMMERs use fictitious IP email addresses. However, like many other schemes in Internet, this is voluntary. Accordingly, emails originating from domains that have not yet adopted SPF are still being accepted at IITB. However, there are many domains who claim to support SPF but have done partial/faulty implementations. In such cases, there is a small chance that an email may not be accepted into IITB network because the originating site has an improper implementation of SPF. "
74,"For more info on SPF, please [click here](http://www.openspf.org/)  #####  FAQ Web based central email service  ![](/assets/icons/Plus.svg)  **Q. When I send mail to username[at]webmail.iitb.ac.in (username represents my friend's userid) they dont reach. What is wrong ?** "
75,"The webmail service of IITB is available at <https://webmail-sso.iitb.ac.in> and <https://webmail.iitb.ac.in>. However, it is not a legal email address. The correct email address of your friend is username[at]iitb.ac.in.  **Q. How do I setup pine to read my webmail mails ?** "
76,"To set up pine to use central MAILBOXes at imap.iitb.ac.in as your mail repository do the following :    1. Go to setup->configure   2. set smtp server as **smtp-auth.iitb.ac.in/tls/user=xxx (xxx is your LDAP id)**   3. **inbox-path: {imap.iitb.ac.in/ssl/novalidate-cert}**   4. now exit setup.   5. Now you should be able to access the Webmail mailboxes, make folders on webmail IMAP server etc. "
77,"If you are using Webmail mailboxes from any computer, all the outgoing emails would have the ID as yourloginname[at]iitb.ac.in. For example, if you set the pine at venus.che.iitb.ac.in to check your mails at webmail and you have login-name 'hemantrm' on venus.che but the login-name 'hemant' at Webmail, then all the mails would go as hemantrm[at]iitb.ac.in. "
78,"To change this do the following:-pine -> Setup -> Config -> Customized headers (it's somewhere at the end).  There, press enter and write the following -  From: your-username-at-webmail[at]iitb.ac.in  and save and exit pine. Now all the mails would go as hemant[at]iitb.ac.in even if I have login-name hemantrm at the server from where the pine is configured to check mails at Webmail. "
79,"**Q. How much is the allotted mail storage quota?**  The server space that has been allotted as of now is as follows:-   Students - 1000MB.  **Q. How do I configure outlook express, eudora, kmail or evolution mail for my MAILBOX on centralized EMAIL servers ?** "
80,These EMAIL AGENTs require two key configurations:  (a) Access to mails received: The mails received for you are located on the centralized IMAP server of IIT Bombay named **imap.iitb.ac.in**.  (b) Server which will accept your outgoing mails: Use **smtp- auth.iitb.ac.in**. Please enable AUTHENTICATION and TLS. You would require LDAP id and password to send mail via this server. For more information click [here](/page/configurewebmail). 
81,"**Q. Why do I receive warning mails regarding virus mails in the attachments from mail server even if I have not sent that mail?**  It is very easy to fake 'From' address in an email. If the mail server finds any infected attachement in the mail, it sends the warning to the 'From' address. In many cases the infected machine which is sending such fake mails might use your mail address in the 'From' field. Hence YOU will get a warning from the mail server regarding the infected mail. "
82,#####  FAQs Spam Mail  ![](/assets/icons/Plus.svg)  **Q. What is SPAM?**  Spam is a type of email. Spam usually takes the form of advertising or promotional material that arrives in your emailbox without you having requested it. 
83,"**Q. What can you do if you receive SPAM?**  You can filter the SPAM mail to a seperate folder based on the subject header. You can also choose to delete the mail with the subject 'SPAM' in it. However, sometimes a 'good' mail also gets marked as SPAM. So it may be a good idea to filter it in a seperate folder and then delete it selectively. "
84,"**Q. How to filter SPAM mails?**  The program that you use to read your mail is known as a mail user agent (MUA). There are options available with all the MUA's (ex:- pine, mutt) to set filters. You need to use these options to set up filter which will filter the mail based on the 'subject' in the email. The SPAM mails will have the word SPAM in the subject. If you are using Pine to read your mail the procedure is specified in the next answer. "
85,"Q. How to filter SPAM mails with Pine. In Pine go to setup. Then press R for Rules, It will ask a question ""Type of rule setup :"" Choose F for Filters. Then press A to add the rule. Go to subject pattern. Press A to add the value. Set Subject pattern to SPAM. Then go to Filter Action and specify the folder name where you want the SPAM mail to go. Then press E to exit setup.

86,"Q. How to filter SPAM mails under Webmail ? The steps to filter SPAM into a separate folder are :   Log into Webmail. Create a separate folder. (For sake of illustration, let us call it SPAMfolder.) Click on the link ""Options"".Once you are in the Options page, choose ""Message Filters"".Inside the Message Filters menu, one can create a new filter withspecifications as below:     1. Match on ""Subject""   2. Choose Subject Line to contain *****SPAM****   3. Choose a folder where the SPAM will be moved (i.e. ""Move to folder"")   4. Save the filter just created. After this, all SPAM will go into the selected ""SPAMfolder"". SPAM mails will be auto-deleted if Trash is chosen as the ""Move To"" folder (i.e. Trash instead of SPAMfolder). "

88,"Netmon Configuration of Netmon proxy can be found [here](/page/configurenetmonproxy)  Netmon FAQ's    Q. What is Netmon IP Blocking? To protect our netmon proxy from bombarding from various portions of our network, we have implemented a scheme in which the IP address remains blocked for 2 hours, once found bombarding netmon proxy. After end of 2 hours, if it is still found bombarding, then it is again blocked for 2 hours and this continues recursively. "
89,Q. Is my IP blocked at the Router? First you need to find out whether your IP is blocked at the router or there is some local problem. If you can ping other computers in your hostel but you cannot ping/telnet/ssh to your department server or other machine outside your router then your machine IP is blocked at the router. Else there is some local problem. 
90,"Q. What can I do if my IP is blocked at the router? Contact your hostel sysad/comp secy to solve the problem. This may be due to no mac entry of your lan card in router or some physical cable/jack problem. If you temprorarily need to access department, you can use your hostel computer room. If it is not resolved you can also take assistance from CC by lodging a complaint using [complaint form](https://help-cc.iitb.ac.in) "
91,"Q. Is my IP blocked at Netmon? Check if other local services such as DNS, Webmail, internal WEB ACCESS, etc are working fine, but Internet is not working. If you are getting authentication window for Netmon proxy server and still not able to access internet then you must have forgotten your password on Netmon proxy server. You are requested to contact sysad/compi secy and get your password reset. If you are not getting prompt for authentication, please check your proxy settings in the browser properly. If they are also correct then check whether your IP is really listed in blocked IP's [here](https://camp.iitb.ac.in/cgi- bin/blockip.cgi) "
92,"Q. What can be a cause for my IP getting blocked? There can be several reasons for IP getting blocked.Your computer must be bombarding netmon with invalid requests. This is usually due to ad-wares or may be due to some software trying to update itself without proper proxy settings. This can also be due to virus infected computer.You can also install a personal firewall which will keep track of all incoming and outgoing requests. Most popular of which is ZoneAlarm.People have to fix their problems *on their own*. Just trace out and resolve it as soon as possible. Unblocking automatically happens only after 2 hours of blocking period, but as said earlier, if it is still found bombarding then it is again blocked for 2 hours and this continues recursively. "

585,"CONTRIBUTORS UG ACADEMIC COUNCIL 2022-23 ISAA, Student Support Services Prapti Sao SSS Coordinators: Akshat Singh Shravya Suresh Ashwin Abraham Tushaar Jhamtani 1. REGISTRATION IIT Bombay follows a specialized credit-based semester system, therefore registration at the beginning of each semester is mandatory for you till you complete your program (lookout for the dates in the Academic Calendar). Without registration, any academic activity (course/seminar/project, etc.) that you undergo will not be counted towards the requirements of your degree."
586,1.1. COURSE ADJUSTMENT A student has the freedom of deletion/addition of one or more courses (after discussing and taking permission from the Fac-Ad) provided the total credits do not exceed the overload rule (discussed in Section 3) or fall below 18 credits by such adjustments. The last date for doing so is about 1 week after the commencement of the semester.
587,"1.2. DROPPING OF COURSES If a student finds their academic load too heavy, even after the date for course adjustment has passed, they may drop some courses out of the registered ones provided the minimum credit limit (18 credits) hold, after taking permission from the Fac-Ad. The last date for doing so is generally 20-30 days after the end of the mid-semester examination and is set in the academic calendar. Such dropping of courses results in a W grade in the transcript for that particular course."
588,1.3. SEMESTER WISE REGISTRATION You can register for the courses you intend to take during a given semester on the basis of the program for your discipline as given in your curriculum and as per the advice given by your Faculty Advisor (Fac-Ad). The Faculty Adviser is expected to discuss with the student their academic performance during the previous semester and decide the number and nature of the courses for which they can register during the semester within the framework of the guidelines as
589,"1. REGISTRATION approved by the Institute. You can check a particular semester’s curriculum on ASC. Follow the path: Academic --> All about courses --> Curriculum. Kindly note: From the third semester onwards, registration is dependent on"
590,"the Academic Standing of the student. The registration process (which is online) involves filling up an Online Course Registration Form (CRF) stating the courses and project/seminar etc, that the student proposes to complete during that semester as per the prescribed curriculum. All students having outstanding dues to the institute or a hostel shall not be permitted to register online."
591,"You can find a detailed guide on ASC and the registeration process in the ASC Video Series. 2. CATEGORY OF COURSES 2.1. CORE COURSES Core courses are those courses which you have to do compulsorily for obtaining your degree. These courses count towards your final degree in all respects and count in your CPI (Cumulative Performance Index). These courses are NOT optional and have to be completed within the stipulated duration of your coursework (4 or 5 years). They give you a lot of exposure to your own departmental subjects and research; They also have an elective component, details regarding which are explained in the section on electives."
592,"2.2. MINOR COURSES A Minor is an additional credential a student will earn if they do minimum 30 credits worth of additional learning in a discipline other than their major discipline. Many academic units in the Institute offer minors in their disciplines and prescribe a specific set of courses and/ or other activities like projects for earning a minor in that discipline. Note that courses equivalent in content to any of these specified courses from the same department can be taken as a minor course with the approval of the concerned HOD. After the completion of credits under the stipulated time period, a minor degree is awarded to the student. It is mentioned in the Degree Certificate ""Bachelor of Technology in xxx with Minor in yyy.” The fact will also be reflected in the transcript, along with the list of courses taken."
593,"Minor courses are allocated to students only through a pre-registration process before the start of every semester and the allocation for every minor course is done on the basis of the CPI of the student as the seats are limited in every minor course. You can opt for as many courses of your choice during the process of pre-registration (in particular preference order). You will be allotted the minor course based on your CPI and preference order after the pre-registration window closes. The waitlist that is maintained for the minor courses (for students who have missed out on the course of their choice) is also sorted on the basis of the CPI of the students, such that if any student who has got the minor"
594,"2. CATEGORY OF COURSES course drops it during the process of registration, the next student in the waitlist will get the minor course. Note - The only way to get a minor is through the pre-registration window. It would not be possible to register for a minor on the main registration window."
595,"Please refer to the UG Rulebook to check the eligibility criteria to register for minor courses. The pre-registration process for minors is explained in this video. 2.3. HONOR COURSES Honor is an additional credential a student will earn if they opt for the extra 24 credits (in some cases, 30) needed for this in their own discipline. The concerned department specifies the course requirements for earning the honors. An honor is like a specialization in your own discipline."
596,"Honor courses are either advanced-level courses in your discipline or are courses designed to give you more exposure to different areas of your discipline. This will be mentioned in the Degree Certificate as “Bachelor of Technology in xxx, with honors” on the successful accumulation of credits at the end of the program. The fact will also be reflected in the transcript, along with the list of courses, etc., taken."
597,Dual Degree students have to do the honors courses by default. They are considered as their core courses. honor courses do not count in your CPI other than for dual degree students.
598,"Please refer to the UG Rulebook to check the eligibility criteria to register for honor courses. 2. CATEGORY OF COURSES 2.4. ELECTIVES Every program (B.Tech/Dual degree/BS) in IIT Bombay will have its own curriculum defined, which will define your core courses and the total credit requirement for the award degree. According to your curriculum, your course completion may require doing courses of your own choice, wish and interest from:"
599,"Dept. of Humanities and Social Sciences All undergraduates are required to do a Humanities elective from the HSS department in a particular semester, depending on the department, and have to choose this elective from the following set:"
600,"HS 301 Philosophy HS 303	Psychology	 HS 305	Reading Literature	 HS 307 Sociology Your own department - Department Elective As per your curriculum, you may be required to choose a few courses (number varying across programs) of higher-level (Say 4xx or 5xx) from your department across a pool of courses put forward by your department. In some cases (varying across departments), you might be allowed to take up courses from other departments and tag them as a department elective. It is best to check up with your departments regarding the same."
601,"2. CATEGORY OF COURSES A department other than yours - Institute Elective As per your curriculum, you may be required to choose a few courses (number varying across programs) from a foreign department. Generally, you are free to choose any course out of your department as Institute electives. Departmental-based restrictions may be there for a few courses. Note: 1xx courses are generally not allowed to be taken as institute electives (except for some departments)."
602,"For IDC and SJMSOM courses, you can ask the Department General Secretary/ Department Undergraduate Committee of your department if they will allow a particular IDC / SJMSOM course to be tagged as an institute elective. All these electives are a part of the core curriculum"
603,"and will count in your CPI. 2.5. ADDITIONAL LEARNING COURSES Based on the academic standing of a student, there is an upper cap on the number of credits they can take. You can find details about academic standing in the UG Rulebook. Apart from core courses, a student can take some extra courses. Additional learning courses (ALCs) can be credited or audited. These ALC courses don’t constitute the core CPI/SPI of a student. The tag of such a course can be changed during the retagging period, which is explained later."
604,Note: Exceeding any of the criteria for credits is NOT admissible under any circumstances. 2.6. AUDIT COURSES Audit courses refer to the courses for which there are no credits; you want to
605,"complete the course simply for knowledge with no concern about a grade. Registrations for such courses are done along with the main registrations, with prior permission from the instructor. Only students belonging to categories I and II are permitted to ‘Audit’ a course during regular semesters and summer terms, and on can audit a maximum of two courses during their entire program."
606,"2. CATEGORY OF COURSES If completed, the course will be mentioned in the transcript as an ‘Audit.’ The instructor will award the ‘AU’ grade if the attendance is satisfactory and additional requirements as set out by the instructor are met. If the attendance and performance are not satisfactory, the instructor will NOT award any grade, and the student would be deregistered from the course. The “AU” grade doesn’t carry any grade point and is not included in the SPI/CPI calculations."
607,"2.7. SIT THROUGH There may be a case where you are really interested in a particular course but are unable to register for the same due to some constraints (generally happens with popular minor courses). However, you may be willing to sit in that course just for knowledge, without any privilege for credits or mention in the transcript. In that case, you can ask the faculty in charge’s for permission to 'sit through' that course."
608,"Note that there are no registrations for a Sit-Through. 2.8. SUPERVISED LEARNING PROJECT (SLP) Supervised Learning Project (SLP), also known as RnD in some departments, is a project-based course - generally for 6 credits, where a student can work for one entire semester on a project under a professor. It is not always necessary to do a project under a professor in your department. The professor you choose can be from a different department, but it is subject to rules and conditions laid down by your department."
609,"2.9. IR LANGUAGE COURSES International Relations (IR) language courses are the courses that are offered for the benefit of students as well as staff of IIT Bombay. These courses are offered in many languages such as Japanese, French, Italian and German."
610,You can contact the Institute Secretary International Relations (ISIR - UG) for more details about the IR language courses. 2. CATEGORY OF COURSES To summarise the above: Type of Course	Description	Effect on CPI	
611,Minors	30 credits worth of additional learning in a discipline other than your own major.	Don't count towards CPI	 Honors Electives	30 credits worth of additional learning in a discipline other than your own major.	Don't count towards CPI

613,"Department Electives	Additional courses in your own department.	Count towards your CPI	 Additional Learning Courses (ALCs)	Any extra course, in any department, by your choice, taken up for extra learning.	Don’t count towards CPI	"
614,Audit Courses	Wanting just an exposure to a course - without obtaining a good grade - maximum of 2 audit courses in the entire period of study.	Don’t count towards CPI	
615,Sitting through a course only for exposure Sit through without registering for it Don’t count towards CPI NOTE: All courses which count towards major CPI are compulsory to complete the minimum requirement for a degree.
616,"3. WHY SHOULD ONE TAKE UP A MINOR Minor courses allow you to officially explore a department other than yours while at the same time getting credit for it. It adds value to your major degree and can be a gateway to get opportunities in the field you have completed your minor in. Your minor degree can give you sufficient knowledge to enable you to take part in interdisciplinary research and even pursue your higher studies in such fields. Though a minor degree can be pursued simply out of genuine and deep interest in a particular department without any specific end goal in view, for the general majority, you should select it in such a way that it either suits your major degree in a research-oriented interdisciplinary manner or in a generic way to any engineer or scientist."
617,"Before you select a minor, try to find what you are truly interested in. It is surely not easy for everyone to be crystal clear about this, but even a vague idea will help you enjoy the minor courses and truly enrich the experience. You can always sample courses from various departments to find this interest, but you lose the benefit of a minor degree in doing so."
618,"You can select any minor course from any department, but to draw the complete benefit out of it, you should look for overlap between them and your discipline so that it supplements your learning. You should also look at how all the minor courses fit in with each other for a more holistic approach; some departments draw up a suggested schedule of when each minor course must be taken to reap the full benefits out of the curriculum. Minor courses don’t count in your CPI, so you should select a minor based on your interest."
619,"Listed next is a suggested set of minor programs which may suit each branch. This matching is done by looking at how much overlap each discipline has with respect to other fields so that the minor programs can support the interdisciplinary learning of each student, depending on their career plans. Use it only as a guide and not a binding set of rules; don’t let it dissuade you from pursuing what interests you."

WHY SHOULD ONE TAKE UP HONORS Honor courses are either advanced-level courses in your department or are courses designed to give you more exposure to different areas in your department. They help you get deeper knowledge in your department to prepare you for higher studies or to take a job in a particular specialized area so that you can compete with, say, an M.Tech who has specialized in the same area. You are likely to develop strong subject skills by completing an honor successfully and sincerely. Undergraduate classes introduce you to a wide breadth of topics and challenges, and an Honors project enables you to explore one in much greater depth. Honors research topics are varied and negotiable – if you are really interested in a topic and want to learn more about it, you’ll be encouraged and supported. From a potential employer’s perspective, whatever your department, it appears laudable to have demonstrated the ability to achieve a complex and demanding goal and have in-depth knowledge in your department. Honor courses also help you if you want to pursue further studies or research in the future. Honors provide you with a deeper understanding and chance to explore sub-domains and make an informed choice about the topic of future exploration. Also, since you have more dedicated knowledge in your specialization, there are higher chances that your profile will get noticed by universities for their MS/Ph.D. programs. To complete the honor, 24 credits must be completed by tagging courses in your department as honor electives. They don’t count in your CPI; a separate honors CPI is maintained. This means that taking some honor courses but not being able to complete the entire 24 credits does not harm you in any way; it, in any case, enables you to delve further into your department."
626,5. TAGGING RULES Every course you do in the institute falls under one of the categories of courses as described in section 1. Tags are given to courses to classify them. The tags of electives can be changed as per the rules that follow.
627,"This facility allows students to do additional courses and finally make select courses count towards 'Core CPI' (the CPI of prescribed curriculum credits) Rules: Re-tagging will be available to students ONLY TWICE in their entire program duration, the first time before placements (Second Last Semester Starting) and second time post curriculum completion (Last Semester)."
628,"The courses that have been re-tagged during the opportunity given during the previous window will be debarred from the re-tagging process. NOTE: From the year 2017 onwards, the tagging window for DD (Category I) Students will also be the same as the re-tagging window of their B.Tech counterparts (those who are graduating). For them (Category I DD students), the second window for re-tagging will be made available at the time of graduation. This has been done to ensure a fair process of selection for the institute medals."
629,"For the rest of the categories’ DD students, the first tagging window will be opened in the Autumn Semester before placements and the second one at the time of their graduation."
630,5. TAGGING RULES Tags of courses: 1. Core Course - C 2. Department Elective - D 3. Institute Elective - I 4. Minor Course - M 5. Additional Learning Courses - T
631,6. Honors course - O An approved change of tag will result in fresh calculation of SPI/ CPI from the semester. The tag change has been made effective due to the fact that additional learning course(s) do NOT constitute the core SPI/ CPI of a student.
632,Following is a table specifying the current rules about the changing of tags from one to another and the restrictions put on the same: TAG CODE TAG DESCRIPTION T Additional Learning
633,"CHANGEABLE INTO D, I, O, E C Core Course Not changeable D Department Elective O, T, E O Honours Course D, E, T E Honors Elective D, O, T H Humanities Elective T"
634,"5. TAGGING RULES TAG CODE TAG DESCRIPTION CHANGEABLE INTO I Institute Elective T M Minor Course I, T Please check for the updated retagging rules here before making any decision as these are subject to change."
635,"NOTE: For any special requests i.e. a change, which cannot be implemented on the tagging interface, the student has to get approval from the HOD of the concerned department (other department in case of minors)."

648,"Japanese can be a very daunting language to start as it's ranked the toughest language to learn for the native English speakers, which I think most of you would use as the language of conversion while learning. It has sounds that aren't present in English or even Hindi, so it can be a bit challenging in the start to grasp it but otherwise it should be fine with practice and more classes. The sentence structure is also quite different from English. Some phrases do not have a direct translation in English so it could be a nice experience to understand a language in a more intuitive sense."
649,"WHY JAPANESE? I have been fascinated by the language for a long time now. I used to do calligraphy and that's where I started writing in Japanese even before I understood what exactly they meant. I had a very personal attachment to the Japanese culture and the place (mostly due to calligraphy and stationery), so it felt right to take up a language course. I also am very passionate about learning languages in general and that gave me the last push I needed. I would suggest you take up the course only if you have some sort of ""why"" to learn the language cause it can get hard to manage the academic load and give enough attention to a non credit course."
650,"COURSE LOAD The course load wasn't a lot on paper but a lot in all other sense, as we didn't really get any assignments regularly but if you really want to make some progress in the course, it would be advisable to put extra effort in learning the language. The class timings were like your regular classes as slots. ."
651,"8. IR LANGUAGE REVIEWS REGISTRATION There will be a webmail about it during the start of the autumn semester where you would get the class slots and registration guidelines, you'd have to pay a fee of around 1500 (at my time) for a two semester course."
652,"INSTRUCTOR The course instructor was one of the sweetest professors I have had and he made it easier to gather motivation to learn the language. He is quite structured and have enough experience in teaching. He'd give the documentation for the class beforehand so you can go through it. He also conducts tea parties to learn about Japanese culture but sadly I did it all online :( Online, the course was harder to follow due to network and other constraints on the instructor's side but I believe offline would be a wonderful experience."
653,MYTHS I think the major myth about this course specifically is that you'd be able to talk fluently by the end of the course. The instructor would say that you can but that's a lot dependent on you and how much you can keep up the motivation till 2 semesters.
654,"OVERALL EXPERIENCE The major thing to keep in mind is that don't take this course if it clashes with your core courses slot as it would be very very difficult to manage and attend regular classes. You should also treat this as a more fun and enjoyable experience rather than a course you have to give an exam (you have to btw) for. It would be a good experience to gain proficiency in this language and also, with a bit of more practice you can write the JLPT, so that's one other plus ;)"
655,"8. IR LANGUAGE REVIEWS 8.2. GERMAN Review by Darade Vaibhav Vinayakrao INTRODUCTION The German language is widely spoken in four European countries: Germany, Austria, Belgium, and Luxembourg. German is also an official language in Switzerland and Liechtenstein. Alphabets are quite similar(except for a few - ä, ö, ü and ß) to the English language but grammatically German and English are quite different(You must have seen the memes!). Sometimes we used to relate the things with the Hindi(in my case I used to relate them with Marathi as well) so that it becomes easy to break down and understand. Formal and informal structures of speaking are very important in the German language."
656,"WHY GERMAN? I was interested in German culture(more from the academic point of view, I like their educational structure a lot). Along with that Germany is the most preferred country to work in for Mechanical engineers(which is my interest) so it was natural for me to choose this language. Motivation to study the language only for doing the job is necessary but won’t be sufficient in the long run so little cultural interest will help. It will help you when you start losing interest in it after some time and also you will have to find the time on a regular basis for this commitment during the hectic semester schedules(some students from my batch ditched it because of this). So if you are interested and can assure yourself of time commitment then go for it! (Just to note - this is not the credit course whose grade will be counted towards the CPI) Note: It is not very easy to attain a working level proficiency in any language. At the end of this course, you will have knowledge almost equivalent to an A1 certificate certified by CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for"
657,"8. IR LANGUAGE REVIEWS Languages). After successful completion of the course, you get a certificate which is issued by DAAD (Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst) certifying the completion of the course with the score/grade obtained in the course. Generally, companies demand at least a B1 level of proficiency. There are 6 levels A1 A2 B1 B2 C1 C2 (increasing order of proficiency from left to right) certified by Goethe Institut."
658,"COURSE LOAD The course is for one complete academic year. There were two batches, one had lectures on Monday and Thursday and the other one had lectures on Tuesday and Friday. For both batches timing was 5 pm to 7 pm on these days. There are a total of 100 hours of classes throughout the academic year (50 in each semester). After every class, we used to get small exercises that can be completed in a max of 60 minutes. Courseload is quite manageable. One piece of advice I would like to give is that - try to give time for the language every day however small it is like keep in touch with the language! Books we used to refer to are Netzwerk_A1_KURSBUCH and Netzwerk_A1_ARBEITSBUCH for exercises."
659,REGISTRATION The course is organized and conducted by the Office of the Dean of International Relations along with the other Language courses. We had received the mail on student notices about the IR language courses and following the instructions in it will get you registered. We had gotten the form that needed to be filled out. It had questions like motivation and where will you use it etc which were evaluated and selections were made based on it(condition of small interviews was also there in some cases)… If any doubts you can always contact the ISIR(Insti Sec of International Relations) or IR office or check the IR website.
660,"INSTRUCTOR For our batch, Mr. Samer Khader was the instructor. He conducted the course 8. IR LANGUAGE REVIEWS quite well. Classes were kept as interactive as possible. Our first semester was online but breakout rooms were used effectively which helped us to have one-to- one conversations which are important in learning any language. He used to ask students as well for any improvement or activities which will help in enhancing the overall learning. His understanding of language was really good and also could give satisfactory explanations of the doubts(his English was also quite good)."
661,"MYTHS ‘German is spoken only in Germany’ or ‘German is a very difficult language’, Sometimes it feels that way though! ;) or ‘German doesn’t sound nice’. Myths are always there but if you are really interested, go for it don’t waste time thinking about the myths. (to be honest, to write this answer I had to google the myths (LOL) - so you should get that they don’t matter really)"
662,"OVERALL EXPERIENCE As I said earlier, after some time it’s hard to find time for the languages but it was the other way round for me. I used to consider them as taking my mind out of hectic sem work and this helped me to attend almost all the classes(more than all other batchmates for sure! ;) ). Also, a group was formed which was helpful throughout the year to keep up with language studies. I would like to re-iterate that finding the time on a regular basis (as it gets difficult during the semester after midsems) will be really helpful so try to do it. In overall it was a nice experience to learn a new language and would suggest you as well to try it! (only if you are interested though, haha ;) )"
663,"9. EQUIVALENT COURSES FOR CLEARING BACKLOG For the purpose of clearing backlogs, a list of equivalent courses which can be done has been given below. It is to be noted that these courses are not equivalent by default; but due to the similarity in the course structure, students are allowed to take them in lieu of the corresponding backlog courses. This is of course subject to approval from"
664,the competent department authority. Approval needs to be taken from the DUGC for tagging two courses as equivalent that are not given in this list. Backlog Equivalent Course ME 346: Heat Transfer

668,"Q. If I get an FR Grade in a minor course, do I need to repeat the course? And will it reflect in my final transcript? A. No, you do not need to repeat the course. However, an 'FR' grade will reflect on the course, under the additional courses done."
669,"Q. What's the difference between an ALC, Audit and sitting through a course? A. Additional Learning Courses (ALCs) do not count towards your CPI but are involved in tagging - if you tag it later as an elective, the grade you get then counts in your CPI. When you audit a course, you do it without obtaining a grade - you get an ‘AU’ on successful completion of the course, which does not carry grade points. Formal registration is required for both these, and they appear on your transcript. But for sitting through a course, you don’t need to register for it, nor does it appear on your transcript."
670,"Q. If one gets an FR in Elective HS *xxx*, do they need to repeat the same course or can they take up Elective HS *yyy* in its place? A. Yes, they can take *yyy* as their HSS elective by changing the tag of HS *xxx* to additional learning and registering for *yyy* in the next semester as HSS-Elective."
671,"Q. What about the credits when one does some honor courses but not enough for an honors degree? A. If one has completed some honor courses but not enough to acquire an honors degree, then those courses would be counted under Additional learning Courses. Some departments allow to tag these as Department/other electives as well."
672,"Q. Suppose I take up any other random subject course, but I don’t want to get a minor; will that course show up anywhere while passing out? A. The grade that you obtained in the course will show up in the transcript. All the courses taken up as a minor are converted to an ALC unless you have completed 30 prescribed minor credits in a particular department."
673,"11. SOME USEFUL NOTES If you have successfully done the pre-registration of a course (Minors/ HSS Electives), then at the time of registration, the allott ed pre-registered course comes under the heading “Pre Registered Courses” on your ASC interface, and you need not register for the course again under any other heading say Institute elective, Non-Credit Course, Additional course etc."
674,"Course not listed - If you get a message on the interface saying that the course is not running this semester even though it is, please check the division (‘M’,’ S1’, etc.) in the list of running courses and enter the correct division on the interface while registering for it."
675,"Entering the division as ‘M’ will not change your tag to a minor (All about courses → Running Courses) e.g. CE 310 - M, MM 474 - M, CS 101 - D1/D2/D3/D4, etc."
676,"Prerequisites pains - If there are errors, please send a mail to asc.help@iitb.ac.in with a screenshot using your LDAP ID only; if the grade for the prerequisite course is not out want to take a course without clearing the prerequisite, please get permission from the course instructor."

692,"PREFACE Hi everyone, The Undergraduate Academic Council aims to keep all the students acquainted with the different rules and policies of our Institute academic system. This UG Information Booklet is another effort on our part to centralise information from all sources, and deliver it to the students in a concise yet clear form. In this year’s revamped booklet, we’ve made sure to include a wide range of topics that we feel the students must be aware about- from Scholarship Portal to Fast Tracking to detailed reviews of various programs, and much more! As a student of this institute, it is highly recommended that you go through this booklet to be well versed with the rules that will be affecting your academics and the plethora of opportunities the institute has to offer. Lastly, we’ve put our best efforts in compiling this booklet and presenting the information to you. Even then, some inadvertent errors might have crept in, and we would be grateful to be informed about the same Priyanka Bagade Institute Secretary of Academic Affairs Head – Student Support Services (2020-2021) "

694,"MAI HU GIAN... Gian (not the one from Doaremon!) is a Global Initiative of Academic Networks. Under this initiative you get to do courses which are emerging in the fields of research, industry interests etc. Now you might wonder how is it exactly different from other courses at IIT, and this is where the twist lies. The courses are conducted over 5-12 days in collaboration between an institute professor and one or more international faculty. These courses focus on emerging areas of research & industry interest and are conducted by experts. Monetarily speaking, these courses are heavily subsidised for IIT students (almost 90%). The courses start right from basics and then build on them to teach advanced concepts related to cutting edge technology in recent years. ""Courses are conducted over 5-12 days in collaboration between an institute professor and one or more international faculty"" "

696,"For a comprehensive list of courses that are offered at IIT Bombay, click here.  FAST TRACKING Fast tracking of degrees is the completion of B.Tech degree in 3.5 or in exceptional cases 3 years . If a student completes the required coursework (credit requirements for that particular degree) and wishes to utilize the last semester(s) in some other activities,the student can get a provisional degree and leave the institute earlier, although the final degree will be awarded at the formal convocation itself. ""The students who choose to pursue this option would still be eligible to sit for the placements in December and can even start working as soon as they are placed."" Students can indulge in other activities like internships, preparation for competitive exam, entrepreneurial ventures or even travelling. IIT Bombay became the first IIT to implement the idea of fast-tracking of degrees. It is worth noting that the accumulation of credits for fast tracking of your degree starts only from the beginning of your sophomore year. 8 "
697,"Review by- SHASHANK BATRA When and why did you choose to fast-track? Basically, what was the plan during the extra semester? I came to know that some engineering colleges offer the option of completing the degree early, before getting into college, and the idea appealed to me. So I was quite excited when my ISMP mentor told me, right in the first semester, that something like this is being planned for us as well. The decision was a no-brainer for me. Back then, the idea of completing something ahead of time sounded interesting. Having some extra time for myself wasn’t a bad deal either. After the first year though, as my interests got more concrete and my career plan became clearer, I decided that if I get placed into a nice tech company, I’d travel a little and then start working earlier than usual. If not, I would have just taken some time off for some projects, hobbies, and traveling. ""All this meant that in the first 4 out of my last 5 semesters, I had around 50 credits. It could have been way more relaxed, so that’s the choice that you have to make."" How did you keep up with the increased course load (also managing stress)? Any unique/different ways you handled acads in the last 2.5 years, compared to the first year (when there was no fast-track)? The method to fast-track is to complete the electives from the last semester beforehand. If you don’t have a minor, that’s just one extra course per semester, and, honestly, that’s not much of an extra load. Most students take some additional courses now and then so that one extra course per semester is almost always there for everyone. For me, along with those electives, I had a minor (which I enjoyed and was pretty sincere about) and a couple of extra courses due to the change of branch. So that meant an extra 2-3 courses each semester. Along with that, I had a couple of in-sem internships, and I also ended up choosing more involved projects for my electives out of interest. 9 "
698,"Were you able to devote time to non- academic activities? If yes, what were they? Things we do in our college obey the Parkinson’s Law. Above a threshold of commitments, you’re going to be busy no matter what. So a few extra credits don’t really change that. I was able to take out time for some hobby projects, be involved with NSS for a semester, and have a couple of in-sem internships. In my placements semester, I had to complete 41 credits. I was quite happy with the apparent “reduced” workload (41 instead of the usual 50) until I realized that many students had taken the minimum possible courses in order to prepare better. So I was definitely at a disadvantage, and it was something that required me to work extra hard and made things quite hectic. Such things should be planned beforehand. ""You won’t have as much time for other things as your peers would. Workload (and stress) increases exponentially (and not linearly) with commitments."" Anything else you would like to tell regarding fast-tracking? You should know “why” you’re doing it. Everyone you know would ask you this question. And in times of increased stress or workload, you would too. You would be working more just to maintain your performance. You would probably miss out on the most “chill” semester, and you might have an extremely hectic placements semester. You would know it when you’re going through these problems, and you would always have the choice of dropping/quitting something or going back on your decision. Always keep these options open. Also, “whether or not to fast-track” is not something everyone needs to consider. You would already know if you want to do it or have the reason for it, and it is then that you should consider the pros and cons. Discuss it with your seniors and make an informed decision. 10 "
699,"Application Students have to get approval from respective department committees (DUGC/DPGC) and submit the application to Dean IR (International Relations) office. Dean IR will take the final call on nominations. Selection Criteria First preference is given on the basis of CPI Preference is given to DD students over B.Tech if CPI is same Balance is maintained among different departments without compromising the CPI cutoff Preference to first time applicants Preference may be given to second time applicants if it is the last chance for him/her.

Process for IITB students- Click here Coursework exchange guide - Click here INTER IIT SEMESTER EXCHANGE Every IIT has its own centres of excellence. A student can now go and spend a semester or two at one of his/her preferred IITs. The credits earned during the stay will be exchanged. The benefits of the Inter IIT Semester Exchange program are that students gain access to new courses, new ways of learning and new facilities, which are not available in their own institute. Each institute can send a maximum of two students for one semester to each of the other two institutes. Hence, each IIT can have a maximum of 4 outgoing students and a maximum of 4 incoming students. Students have to pay tuition fees at the home institute. The host institute will provide the visitor appropriate accommodation on-campus for the entire duration of their visit. However, students will have to bear own costs for the living expenses (including accommodation) at the host institute. The process differs to international exchanges in the way that instead of looking for active MoUs on the IR website, the interested student has to approach the IR office (through the ISIR) in the semester preceding the exchange for an impromptu MoU to be worked out with any of the IITs. 11 "

701,"IDDDP PROGRAM Interdisciplinary Dual Degree Programme is one wherein students with a B.S, B.Tech or DD (B.tech+ M.tech) can apply for a masters in a different branch than the one they are currently studying in. The interdisciplinary program is education by choice. It combines interests that allow students to make discoveries and connections rarely possible in the narrower confines of a single-subject major. It is only for the movement of students from one academic unit to another. With this opportunity, students can pursue their interests in multiple fields. Am I eligible for this program? You, irrespective of your department can apply for an IDDDP at the end of sixth semester. You semester, students must have CPI>=7.5 and should not have any FR/DR/DX/W grade in mandatory courses including NSO/NSS/NCC. Through IDDDP programme, you can apply for all the specializations of Dual Degree and MTech programmes approved by the Academic Senate of IITB. Over and above this minimum eligibility criteria, a DUGC/DPGC may enforce additional eligibility and selection criteria[ through Academic Senate of IIT Bombay]. If admitted to B.S. programmes through Maths Olympiad, you are not eligible. We realise this is new for us all, therefore we have some reviews for you to refer to! More information about IDDDP can be found here. Check out UGAC's YouTube channel for better insight! 13 "
702,"Arush Gupta My name is Arush Gupta and I switched from the Mechanical engineering dual degree programme (specialisation - Thermal-Fluids engineering) to an IDDDP in Mech B.Tech + Elec M.Tech (specialisation - Microelectronics) Your motivation - Simply put, I could not pursue, entirely, my research interests in my former dual degree programme, so I switched to IDDDP in order to be under the guidance of the professor (who is in electrical engineering) whom I wanted to work with. What about minor courses? I had not done any courses in the electrical engineering department before converting to IDDDP. My decision was based purely on my research interests, and the professor whom I was interested in working with. How was the course load? Slightly lesser than it is for the regular dual degree kids - dual degree kids have somewhere between 3 to 5 more courses than the folk from IDDDP. Again, it depends on the department that you'd be going into. For IDDDP in Microelectronics (electrical), they want you to do about 3 more courses over the minimum number of courses (4 courses) listed in the IDDDP description. Just looking at the logistics, since you'd have an M.Tech. degree (hopefully in the department of your choice), it should better your situation than say, if you were not to have a specialized degree in a field that you would like to work in. 14 "
703,"Does it result in better prospects for future? I haven't gone through either of the placement process or the grad school application process and am hence, unaware of how it would help as such, but What are the prerequisites to fulfil before converting to IDDDP? The way I understand it, it's that either 1. you have to have done 18 credits of minor courses in the department that you want to switch to for your IDDDP *and* have a professor who is willing to take you in for a project, or 2. you have to have a professor who is strongly willing to take you in as her/his student for the IDDDP. What are the key take-away points? With the liberty in taking courses, it has definitely helped me be a lot less stressed than I used to be in my former programme; my former programme had loads of core courses that got very repetitive, so I got flattened out a lot because of that and the IDDDP provided me a great means to sway toward the field that I was interested in, by letting me take courses in which I knew that I’d get to learn something new. So, yeah, go for it if you wanna learn new things :)) 15 "
704,"aTRI DUTTA My name is Atri Dutta and I switched from B.Tech in Electrical Engineering to M.Tech in Engineering Physics. Your motivation- After my first year, I was extremely unsure about whether to go for a branch change from electrical to physics or not. Fast forward to the start of the fourth year, having done some work under a prof and a bunch of courses, it became clear to me that I wanted to be in Physics for the future. Although I had done some courses, it was clear to me that there was a gap in the coursework needed to successfully pursue a PhD in my field of choice. So after B.Tech, I would have to go for a masters before a PhD. A masters degree in an American university costs an insane amount, while here, it is practically free, with extremely good quality of coursework. What about minor courses? It is usually important to have some coursework in the target department. I started off by doing the minor curriculum, but halfway, I diverged to taking up courses that were more suited to my interests. All in all, I had done 5 physics courses before applying to the department. The department usually looks for a few mandatory courses, like Classical Mechanics and Quantum Mechanics-1, which are integral to any physics curriculum. 16 "
705,"How was the course load? There are two options for IDDDP, with and without honors. Both options require that your BTech credits are completed from your parent department. With honors requires 9 theory+DDP project (126 credits) and without honors requires 4 theory+DDP project (96 credits). It is important to be aware of what course load you can take, and plan accordingly before applying. Does it result in better prospects for future? In my case, it allowed me to do some necessary coursework which I would have to do at some point in my education. It is definitely better to do it now than repeating the same stuff in your PhD.It allowed me a bit more time to carry out some more research in the institute, as well as find a better topic for my DDP. What are the key take away points? I’d suggest people thinking about an IDDDP to think carefully about what they’d like to do in that time, make a detailed course plan, and stick to it. Doing so many additional credits in just an extra year can be quite stressful. In addition, it is necessary to fix a general direction to your research beforehand, as you’re asked to choose your guide while applying to the department for an IDDDP. Although the process is quite long and it adds an extra year, it’ll definitely be amazing, with the right company, and the right motivation. 17 "
706,"Maulik BHatt My name is Maulik Bhatt and I switched from B.Tech in Aerospace Engineering to M.Tech in Systems and Control Engineering Your motivation- After my third-year internship, I had to decide on what to do further. I was not sitting for placements as I didn’t want a non-core job and there are almost zero core jobs for an Aerospace B.Tech student through campus placements. I could have gone for further studies abroad but I was not completely sure about it. A dual degree was a good option as it would give me more time to decide on my plans and strengthen my profile. A senior who was pursuing IDDDP in SysCon suggested that if I wanted to keep working in the SysCon department then I should consider converting to the dual degree through IDDDP. How was the course load? The course load is not too much as you get four semesters to complete the courses if you make the decision early enough. However, it varies from person to person and depends on the type of courses that you take. 18 "
707,"What about minor courses? It is not necessary to take up minor courses in the SysCon department. In fact, in the SysCon department, there are three compulsory courses that you need to complete for the minor, and none of the courses can be tagged as a core course or an elective course if you decide to convert to IDDDP. However, it was extremely helpful for me to take up SysCon minor as you need to have a basic understanding of control theory and other relevant concepts taught in the basic courses before taking up graduate-level courses. Does it result in better future prospects? Through the IDDDP I am\have been able to work on research projects that are not limited to Aerospace Engineering and have applications in other fields also. That will certainly count in my application when I will apply for higher studies in fields like robotics which are highly interdisciplinary. In the jobs also, I will be able to apply for all the companies that allow SysCon students. What are the key takeway points? Many of the students are not clear about their plans or want to explore more about other fields before they arrive at a particular decision. The IDDDP is a good choice for such students but you also need to be careful before taking this decision. Research about your destination department before arriving at a decision. Be prepared to bear some extra academic load as you’ll have to do graduate- level courses in a department other than yours. Therefore, go for it only if you are genuinely interested in the particular discipline. Make sure to have a good rapport with your guide in the destination department as it will help you a lot in the transition. 19 "

709,"SPECIAL LEAVE FOR 5 DAYS “Special leave” includes students’ participating in academic activities/ extra curricular activities approved by the Institute. The Head of academic unit shall be the approving authority, on the recommendation of the Faculty Adviser/ Faculty incharge of the respective activity, in which the student is participating. Special leave up to 5 working days (at a stretch or in part) may be sanctioned by the head of academic unit excluding mid/end semester examination in accordance with the academic calendar. Compensation of any missed lab, quiz is at the discretion of respective course instructors. Application shall be recommended by the respective faculty adviser on merits and would also need approval from faculty incharge of the activity. 21 "
710,"BTP/DDP/URA B.TECH PROJECTS AND THEIR GUIDELINES Some departments prescribe a B.Tech project as a requirement for the B.Tech. degree, or as a requirement for Honors wherein under the guidance of a faculty member, a student in the sixth semester or later is required to do innovative work with the knowledge gained in the previous years .The student is expected to do a survey of the literature in the subject, work out a project plan and carry it out through design, analysis, experimentation etc. The project may be offered as a single unit of 12 credits(BTP) or as 6 credits of BTP 1 followed by a BTP 2 of either 6 or 12 credits. Even when not prescribed as a minimum requirement for the degree or when a student is not interested in doing Honours in his/her respective department, he or she can opt to do a BTP as additional learning, if s/he can find suitable supervisor(s) to guide her/him. 22 "
711,"DUAL DEGREE PROJECTS AND THE GRADING PROCESS The project done in the final year of the Dual degree is provided with more credits (varies with departments) and hence given more emphasis compared to the projects done during a B.Tech. This provides an ideal opportunity to explore research life and to check if it suits one or not. FACULTY MEMBERS FLOAT PROJECTS ACCORDING TO THEIR AVAILABILITY AND THEN CHOOSE STUDENTS BASED ON THEIR PROJECTS. This information will be shared after the allotment of M.Tech Project topics, which is scheduled before the Dual Degree Project allotment. The evaluation process and assignment of grades for the Dual Degree Project vary from one department to another. You may ask your project guide/ professor regarding the evaluation process and the metrics that are involved. The rules of DDP are generally dept. specific, Check the rule book for more details. 23 "
712,"UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH AWARDS AND THE GRADING PROCESS The aim of URA is to provide UG students an opportunity to get research exposure/experience by working in a research project under a professor. It gives the student a challenging opportunity to participate in research, and establish his/her research aptitude. It will also appear on his/her grade card as research experience. URA is essentially a recognition of the significant amount of research work done by undergraduate students as part of a project - which might be done under a BTP/DDP or as work under a professor outside the curriculum. URA02 AND 03, IF AWARDED, CARRY CREDITS(6) AND ARE ASSIGNED A LETTER GRADE OF AA All the students who have done significant research work under a professor are eligible for a URA. Another perk of receiving an URA is that it is counted towards one's CPI thereby improving it by a substantial amount. There are 3 levels of URA: 1. URA01 : A recognition of a small research/ developmental effort, successfully completed by a student in the first, second or third year of an undergraduate programme - that is, a B.Tech., 4 year B.S. or a Dual Degree Programme. 2. URA02 : This is to be treated as recognition of truly exceptional work, both in quality and in extent, done in the B.Tech. Project. 3. URA03 : These are to be treated as recognition of truly exceptional work, both in quality and in extent, in the Dual Degree Project. URA02 and 03 if awarded, carry 6 credits and are assigned a letter grade of AA thereby improving one's CPI. URA01, if awarded, is assigned a PP grade. URA02 is awarded exclusively to students doing a BTP while URA03 is only for students enrolled in a Dual Degree course who are doing their DDP. Refer to the rule book for further details. 24 "
713,"PLAGIARISM As a student (and throughout your professional life), it is imperative that you understand what constitutes plagiarism and refrain from committing it. Turning in someone else's work as your own, even with modifications, or reproducing any content without due citation or even failing to put quotation marks when needed can count as plagiarism. There’s also self-plagiarism, which means that you shouldn’t even submit your own pre-published work to a separate forum. HOW TO PREVENT INADVERTENT PLAGIARISM? Paraphrase the information you take (and also cite the source), and don’t copy verbatim as it is. If copying extracts from a source, then it should be copied as it is without any modification within block quotes and should be properly cited. The citing here is usually the addition of page number or paragraph number in case of a web content If some of the material you are using for your research paper was used by you in your current class, a previous one, or anywhere else you must cite yourself. Treat the text the same as you would if someone else wrote it. If you’re writing a research paper you must include the references page or page of works cited. This information is very specific and includes the author(s), date of publication, title, and source. Follow the directions for this page carefully. Referencing a material incorrectly is also defined as plagiarism. You must explicitly request for permission to reproduce a figure in a journal. It should say ""reproduced from ABC with permission from XYZ"" where XYZ is a copyright holder and ABC is the reference. You may typically reuse published data by resorting to extracting the data from the figure/table. 25 "
714,"WHAT PUNISHMENT IS GIVEN FOR THE ACT OF PLAGIARISM? Penalties for reproducing material in seminar reports without proper citation range from a warning (in case the mistake was unintentional) to loss of two grades in the Seminar. For project reports, the minimum penalty is loss of one grade and the maximum penalty is an FR grade. In more serious cases, like deliberately claiming false results on experiments, falsely claiming original content in an M.Tech/M.Phil/PhD thesis, the case should be referred to the ADAC and the minimum penalty is suspension for a period of one year. In exceptional cases, the matter is referred to the Apex Committee and the registration may be terminated, with or without an exit degree depending on the severity of the act. For further info: http://www.iitb.ac.in/newacadhome/punishments201521July.pdf HOW TO CHECK FOR PLAGIARISM? There are many softwares that can be used to assess the similarity index of a report (in % terms). One such system is the ' Turnitin ' system. This cross-checks your work against the world wide web, databases of published material, as well as content previously submitted by other users. It highlights sections of text that are duplicated in other sources. Markers look at the Turnitin results to check whether such duplication is a possible case of plagiarism. The Similarity Index generated is a pointer of how original is the submission. This is then used by the instructor to determine whether the submission is acceptable. For details on how to activate your Turnitin account, refer to the Online Resources section. In the end, there’s far too much to lose by committing plagiarism, and if you do need help on paper, contact your instructor or ask a fellow student for a hand. 26 "

717,"IITB MONASH ACADEMY Established in 2008, the IITB-Monash Research Academy is a major Australian-Indian research collaboration formed between India’s top-ranked Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB) and Monash University. Geared towards PhD training on a sizable scale, the academy brings a solutions- driven approach to addressing global problems. Monash University is Australia’s largest university with a global reputation for making an impact and challenging the status quo. Monash was ranked in the world’s top one percent of universities by Time Higher Education 2016- 2017 and operates at a scale unrivalled by any other Australian-Indian collaboration: with close to 200 PhD students, 400 researchers and 400 research projects to date. Joint PhD program The PhD program at IITB-Monash Research Academy allows graduate students from India to work with both IITB and Monash supervisors, as well as industry partners. A typical scholarship for a student in the program is as follows: Rs 4,20,000 per annum scholarship for the first two years Rs 4,68,000 per annum after first two years A grant of up to A$29,000 per annum in Australia A minimum of one year in Australia working with his/her Monash University co-supervisor (some projects may require the student to be in Australia for a longer period of time or undertake more than one trip) and a waiver of international student tuition fees at Monash University is also included.

718,"KARUNA VEERAMANI A REVIEW OF THE PHD PROGRAM. READ ON TO KNOW MORE ABOUT HER RESEARCH, HOW THE MONASH PROGRAM IS LIKE NO OTHER, AND A FEW TIPS FOR HER JUNIORS. How did you find out about IITB-Monash Academy, and what led you to choose it for your research? I found out about the IITB-Monash Research Academy through the internet when I was conducting random searches for PhD opportunities after my Masters. The point that most captivated me was that students were already provided with a research title - within the purview of which the overall research would be conducted; unlike scenarios where students, only after getting into a PhD into a broad discipline, have to zero in upon a suitable research topic. The advantages of this are many - your literature survey prospects are much higher, your work is more streamlined right from the start, you choose the field only if you are genuinely interested which makes it even more of a responsible decision. Could you explain briefly what your research is about? My research deals with the synthesis and applications of heterogeneous catalysts through continuous flow chemistry. Continuous flow chemistry is a lucrative but recently developed field that allows chemical reactions to happen faster, safer, and in a more efficient fashion while heterogeneous catalysts are highly important materials that assist in the formation and progress of various chemical processes. My research aims to combine these two together and thus result in the development of materials that not only could be produced in a quick and efficient manner but further allow faster and safer progress of chemical processes. What was your experience like in the PhD program? A PhD is one of the best things one can do in life. It is a mixture of everything - happiness and sadness, enthusiasm and frustration, pride and shame, courage and fear, and much more. It teaches you a lot - not just professionally. A PhD is a holistic form of development - both mentally and psychologically. ""No matter what you have and you don’t, just never leave your passion for research at any point. No matter what you are doing - be it a PhD or not, be it in the Monash programme or not, be it any time, any position - show zeal in work. At the end of the day, more than a degree, it is the mental satisfaction that is important. "" How is the research under Monash’s program different from say, research under any IITB prof? Research under the Monash program is mainly different in the way that you get to research under a foreign guide and conduct research for a minimum of 3 months in a foreign land (Monash University, Australia). This is an excellent clause in itself - which is the basis for why this program is extremely productive. You get international exposure during your PhD, you learn the working culture abroad, you get to interact with a lot of people from all over the globe, your horizons widen both in terms of hard and soft skills, you understand how to carry out not just doing research - but also the thinking behind it; you get the opinions from not just one but two supervisors in your research, you get to know the perspectives of many people, etc. It is a lifetime opportunity; and one that is certainly something to be experienced. 30 "

720,"RISE The Rural Immersion program for students of Science and Engineering (RISE) is an initiative is an initiative by CTARA, where students of IITB get an opportunity to be part of a two-week immersive cultural experience of life in rural India. Selected students are placed with a reputed NGO working in the field of rural development. They also get an opportunity to stay in a rural household and get a glimpse of rural life. We have Archisman Biswas, a third year Electrical Engineering Undergraduate talking to us about his experiences and why he decide to be a part of this program, the difficulties he faced and what he took away from the trip THE SELECTION PROCESS I have always been fascinated by the cultural, After this step, there would be an interview social and lifestyle difference between round.The questions asked in the interview different communities. When I got to know round would be related to what my about the RISE program offered by CTARA, I motivation is for participating in this felt that it would be a great opportunity for me to go and explore how life in rural areas is like, what I can learn from their lifestyle and how NGOs in these areas are solving the villagers’ problems. For the application, I had to fill a form providing the basic details about myself, why program and what I would like to learn from the program. After the selection process, there were 2-3 meetings conducted where the selected students and professors in charge of the program planned the overall proceedings of the program. I was assigned to the NGO I am interested in the program and mention “Vayam” who were working for the if I have any previous experience of life in rural areas. upliftment of tribal communities in Palghar. 32 "
721,"""Getting to experience these problems first-hand, I was much more open-minded about the rural lifestyle"" THE EXPERIENCE We stayed in different villages of Palghar The food habits were also quite different during the program. To be honest, it was not at all easy to adjust to a rural lifestyle. It took at least five to six days in order to become habituated to the local rural lifestyle, their from the ones we are used to. The hardest thing to get used to was eating chapatis made of ragi rather than wheat. Every night before going to bed, we needed to ensure food habits, sleep routines, the drinking that there was an adequate amount of water etc. I found it very difficult just to mosquito repellent applied, but still you can’t spend a single day without internet change the fact that you will be bitten at connection, television, or any sort of digital night and your sleep will definitely get media. But gradually all of us adjusted to the hampered. environment. It was the middle of the summer season and by this time most of the natural water bodies in the district dried up. The villagers are There, the morning starts before sunrise. Villagers were already out of their bed, preparing to leave for farming, collecting woods and fetching water when we just used forced to drink waters that they can collect to get out of bed. The afternoons were from the bottom of the wells. It was very periods of intense heat and staying inside hard to accept the muddy water for drinking was the best thing to do during these purposes but slowly and steadily, we all got periods. We did face a lot of challenges accustomed to it. In this day and age, initially but it also made us realize the problems these villagers have to face every single day.

723,"PURSUING ENTREPRENEURSHIP Shikhar Agrawal and Aditya Makkar, students of the Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Design Center respectively, both dropped a couple semesters to work on their start up ideas. Read ahead to know about their experience, where they've answered a few questions regarding their journey. What are you working on? How did you both meet? We are running an organization HelpNow which is building India's most reliable ambulance service by reducing arrival times from 50 minutes to 10 minutes. We have created the largest network of private ambulances in Mumbai and operate our own fleet of HelpNow ambulances. The solution gained popularity during COVID when Mumbai Police, Municipality Corporations, Govt. hospitals partnered with us. We met in the first month of freshie year, where we worked together in a team for XLR8 and then worked together to create an autonomous suitcase for ITSP in summers. Venkatesh Amrutwar, 2017 IIT-B graduate and former Overall Coordinator of E-Cell left his job last year to join us full time for this initiative. Which sems did you drop, and how did you/ are planning to cope up? We dropped two semesters after our sophomore year, that is, our 5th and 6th semesters to focus on entrepreneurship. We plan on getting back to our courses that we missed, and continue this sem that's happening online, from August. How did you make the decision between dropping an year and pursuing your interests or to continue your acads normally? We got funded by YCombinator and some of the reputed Silicon Valley startup founders and investors who are well-known for their experienced advice. There is no set process for dropping a semester. Seeing the merit of the case, the director and dean approved our drop request. Managing academics along with HelpNow was quite difficult being operationally heavy and round-the-clock service. 35 "
724,"""Convincing parents to allow us to take a drop was a challenge, although they have been supporting us for the work and its impact. We took a drop of two semesters after our second year, and will get back to our academics to complete the third year syllabus starting from the coming sem."" What relevant courses/projects etc. did you do before dropping a sem? We didn't take any course related to entrepreneurship but did few projects together. We started a crowdfunding project with Sushant Singh Rajput ""Nebula"" to help people raise money for social and personal causes. We launched a service for insti called ""Cravy"" together with Yateesh Agrawal (CS batchmate), an online store supplying natural superfoods to Students and campus Residents and help increase their performance output in university. We also worked together on ""Glammy""- an online auction house for Movie props and cast signed memorabilia.We were in talks with Nadiadwala Films for Kalank but later got funding for HelpNow and started working solely on it. What are your plans in the future, in regards to entrepreneurship? We are now focused on expanding our self-operated fleet to have better quality control. Our plan is to expand our service to 5 other cities in next 6 months. ""Our vision is to scale our service across India and provide a fast and quality medical response to every one of the 1.3 Billion Indians."" Shikhar Agrawal 36 Aditya Makkar "
725,"ACROSS THE INFINITY CORRIDOR Rishi Venukuru pursued a BTECH in CIVIL ENGINEERING from IIT Bombay, before opting for a MASTERS in DESIGN at IDC. Read the review to know more about his unconventional experience, and how it changed him for the better. Q.1 When did you decide to pursue a degree in Design? What were the main factors that led you to taking this decision? I’d been into some amount of Art and Design during my years at school, and while most of that took a backseat through JEE prep, coming to IITB meant that I was able to start taking courses at IDC through the minor program.The first course I took - Basics of Visual Communication by Prof. Raja Mohanty - was one that I personally quite liked, and over the next six semesters I ended up taking up one IDC course per semester, along with a couple projects. The ‘decision’ to formally pursue design was perhaps taken at the end of third year.I attempted to work on a music + design related project that summer. The M.Des program is a lot more about working on real, and socially relevant design and research projects. I’ve personally engaged a lot more with what could broadly be termed as HCI (Human Computer Interaction) research. ""The manner in which I approached applying for Design"" graduate programs was similar to how my peers were going about their own applications for science and engineering programs, so I was able to get feedback from them along the way."" 37 "
726,"Q.2 How difficult was it to choose a path that was way different from what usually people decided on doing? How did people around you react to it? I didn’t perceive the choice to pursue design as particularly difficult, because my family and friends were supportive of the idea. Not having clear examples of seniors who’d followed similar paths did make things tricky at times though.I relied on a lot of internet advice as I went about preparing my applications for grad school and for the Indian design entrance exams as well. Q.3 How is the course load for an M.Des degree? How is it different from an engineering degree according to you? The M.Des program has 5 disciplines, and I was in Interaction Design, so I’m only commenting on that discipline. The course load has been far more intense than anything I’d gone through in B.Tech. Each semester in first year has 10 courses, that mostly run in modules which are 1 - 4 weeks long. I had to spend a lot more time working on projects because of my lack of a core ‘design’ background in the first sem, but whatever tech + research experience I picked up through B.Tech certainly started helping over the second semester. Almost all learning is project-based, and classes are smaller and much more collaborative (over the first year I worked with all of my 11 classmates on at least one major course project). There are also very few ‘exams’. Campus life is also very different. Most M.Des students have close to no time to meaningfully engage in any co-curricular activities. ""While I was able to do literature and music stuff over the course of B.Tech, academics have consumed all available time in M.Des."" Q.4 What are your plans for the future? Going through the M.Des has definitely helped me identify what I’d like to work on moving forward, with much more clarity than I had at the end of B.Tech. I see myself continuing to engage in academic research in HCI, first through RAships probably, and eventually (hopefully) a PhD. My plans for the immediate future would be to first complete my final projects, and then take a break for a little while. The last two years have been rewarding and exhausting in equal parts, and I’d like to take a few steps back and assess next steps. Q.5 What are some key points you would want to suggest to others who are willing to take up design for their Masters? If you’re broadly interested in design, the IDC minor program is a good starting point, but I’d really recommend that you speak to your peers in the B.Des program, seniors in M.Des, and faculty at the IDC to get a better understanding of what actually happens in that building. If you’re still interested, then IDC is a good place for B.Techs like us to make the switch to design/HCI. "

731,"FOREWORD Dear students, I am excited to share with you the very first edition of the Research 101 booklet. The Undergraduate Student Academic Council has compiled this booklet; it contains articles by both students / alumni and faculty of our Institute, highlighting their experience related to research opportunities at the institute, and outside, as well as sharing their motivation for choosing research as a career. I n a world increasingly propelled by technology, university research is the foundation of any nation's knowledge and economic growth. IIT Bombay is committed to both basic and applied long-term research in frontier areas, to working towards research and development that make a difference both for national needs and for global impact. W e make continuous and concerted efforts to encourage and motivate our young, energetic and highly intelligent student force to undertake research from an early stage, offering various opportunities and faculty mentorship / guidance. T he institute has ongoing academic and research collaborations with many national and international universities, governments and industries, to keep pace with expanding the frontiers of knowledge and global developments. These present a plethora of research areas and problems to our young researchers to be engaged in. T he institute prides itself in having facilitating policies, processes and mechanisms to promote high impact R&D endeavors by faculty, students and staff, spanning across interdisciplinary borders. Supporting and incentivizing researchers, creating an innovation and entrepreneurial ecosystem, and enhancing industry collaboration through various schemes and programmes are some of the benefits that the institute provides for an active research and development ambience. I t is heartening to see that our students have brought out this booklet despite the challenging times of COVID-19. Kudos to the team. I look forward to more issues on a regular basis to motivate our young minds towards a research career.

The academic course structure during my study (2003-07) was slightly different from what it is today. Perhaps the number of credits was higher, and there were no minors and honors. In Mechanical Engineering, we had a seminar (4 credits) in the 6th semester, followed by a compulsory industrial or research internship (PP/NP) in the summer. In the final year, along with BTP (16 credits), we had an Engineering Design Project (EDP) for six credits in the 7th semester. Other departments also had more or less similar course structure. The Seminar ""MANY PROFESSORS helped us to get started with reading research LOVE TO TALK TO articles, technical writing, and presentation.

It is alright to work on multiple projects during the initial years to know where your interests lie. However, it is essential to narrow down to a single project, especially in the final year, and focus all your time and energy. It is crucial to spend adequate time on your research project to produce good quality output. Merely dabbling with different projects won't give you a satisfying experience. 4 BE PERSISTENT Research is never a smooth ride. You are going to make mistakes, you are going to fail. Don't get discouraged when something doesn't work. Mistakes should be embraced as an opportunity to learn, and you should stop harboring a fear of failure. There will be a stage when you get stuck. It is essential to understand that being persistent is the only way out, and it will pay off in the end. It's a part of the learning curve. ARTICLE BY AN ALUMNUS PROFESSOR | PAGE 9 "
736,"Did your expectations from a research career fail to meet/meet/exceed expectations that you had as an undergraduate? As an undergraduate, I had very little idea about life in an academic career. As a faculty, I enjoy a lot of academic freedom and work on something that I really like. I get to select which projects to work on and how to work. I can choose to work on sponsored research projects and, at the same time, take up industrial consultancy projects. I can also get to choose the people to collaborate with and work on multi-disciplinary problems. Besides, the work hours are very flexible. It's rare for a job to offer such freedom. Further, research and teaching ensure that I continuously learn and engage in stimulating problems. The process of mentoring students in research and classroom teaching is indeed a gratifying experience. A research career may not be a lucrative option. Still, it has been a very satisfying job and exceeded my expectations. Given that the job involves diverse tasks such as teaching, mentoring, research, writing proposals and articles, setting up and maintaining laboratory, and administration, it has been both exhilarating and exhausting at times.

738,"About me I was a dual degree student at IIT Bombay from 2002 – 07 in Aerospace Engineering. I subsequently got a PhD from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I work at TCS Research in Pune as a Senior Scientist. Before joining TCS Research, I held tenure-track faculty positions at McGill University, IIT Bombay and Imperial College London. How I got into research as an undergrad and how it helped me Watching my five-year old go about his business, I am reminded of my early years as an undergrad at IIT Bombay. I wanted to learn all I could about atmospheric and space flight, and I would constantly seek a professor to talk to. I found most professors patient enough and willing to have a conversation with a bumbling newbie. These encouraging conversations gave way to small projects – initially during summer and then gradually during the regular semesters. In the first two years, I worked almost exclusively on short projects to get my hands dirty – fabricating a composite wing, determining the moments of inertia of small aircraft experimentally, and even writing assembly-level code for an electronic lock. By the start of year-3, I was working on what ended up being relatively long-term research projects in the areas of flight mechanics and Mr. Aditya Paranjape Senior Scientist, TCS Research Ex.

739,"control: in fact, these projects continued pretty much for the remainder of my stay at IITB. I got a fairly good grasp of the subject area thanks to this work, and I had even authored a few research papers in top-tier international conferences and a respectable Indian journal by the time I graduated from IITB. It happens very often with research that its impact is felt in real terms only after a few years. This is especially true when one considers the impact on one’s technical maturity and temperament. In my case, the research problems from my undergrad days had a significant impact on my PhD as well as on my research program during my early days as an academic. For instance, I started working on the application of bifurcation analysis to flight dynamics towards the end of my sophomore year, but continued working on related problems through my PhD, post-doc and the first couple of years as an academic. It was also largely thanks to one of the papers that I wrote on this subject as an undergrad that I was introduced a few years later to the exciting field of systems biology by one of my collaborators.

740,"GYAAN CORNER Could you give some useful tips to the undergraduates who are thinking of getting into research or exploring it as a career? Taking stock of my undergrad research after over a decade, and having mentored and supervised students at all levels along the way, here’s what I have to offer by way of (hopefully, not entirely useless) advice. Use research to learn the big picture: as early- year undergrads, it is highly unlikely that you have any serious working knowledge of any engineering or scientific discipline, let alone a big picture view. Therefore, rather than aiming to make a splash (and I have seen a lot of students being more worried about this than anything else), use research to get a first-hand glimpse into the world of science and engineering. If you work diligently and systematically on one or two high- quality projects, you will understand how good researchers pose problems, how they formulate a solution, and how they assess their own work and plan the next steps. These are basic skill sets for not just a good scientist or engineer, but also for those who work outside of these fields. At the end of 4/5 years, if you emerge with good problem- solving skills, your research would have been well worth your time and effort. ARTICLE BY AN ALUMNI SCIENTIST | PAGE 14 "
741,"Find out what sort of areas excite you: It is essential that you use your time at IITB to learn what you like to do and what you are good (and not very good) at. By forcing you to persevere on a problem, research will help you cultivate that sense slowly but surely. It is a cliche that we are all wired differently. We like different sorts of things and not all of us are good at everything. Facebook and Twitter will incessantly advertise what your peers are up to, and some of it will get the thumbs-up from your friends. Do not be swayed by it. It’s great to think outside the box, but first, you need to be good at what’s inside. It is a characteristic of our times to seek instant gratification. Unfortunately, research does not work that way. More often than not, good researchers are also those who are able to go deep into their respective technical areas. This sort of depth comes the hard way. You have to take courses seriously, read your text books diligently (and not turn to Google or Wikipedia), and you have to be able to write and solve equations by hand. ARTICLE BY AN ALUMNI SCIENTIST | PAGE 15 "
742,"Be patient. Research is a long-term venture, and ideas take several years to develop and mature. At your stage, you would do yourself a disservice if you seek instant gratification. You should be prepared to put in a lot of grunt work (see the previous point) and you have to read books and research papers thoroughly. More than the amount of information that you gather this way, it is important that you make sense of what you’ve read and how all of the concepts and tools are tied together. All of this takes time, and there are no shortcuts. Document everything systematically and learn to write well. Here’s yet another cliche: your research and ideas are only as good as your ability to communicate them. In the old days, schools would teach their students the importance of good writing skills: the rules of grammar and the appropriate vocabulary. This appears to have fallen out of fashion of late, with the consequence that an increasing number of research papers (especially ones coming from India and Asia at large) are unintelligible.

743,"IF I HAD TO OFFER A SUMMARY OF ALL THAT I HAVE SAID, IT WOULD BE AS FOLLOWS. AT YOUR STAGE, RESEARCH IS ABOUT LEARNING AND DISCOVERING WHAT’S OUT THERE.

I beg your pardon if I do not end this piece soon…It started with all sorts of crazy questions in my mind – Am I cut out for research? Should I choose between MS and PhD? Can I switch fields? Whether or not I should apply for placements and a lot more...Having faced this dilemma for over a year, I was ascertained of pursuing a doctorate after my summer internship in Australia at the end of third year. The experience gave me unmatched satisfaction and resolved all the doubts I had. The freedom to drive the project and immense happiness derived by delving deep into a subject were priceless! The steep learning curve which posed enormous challenges and oftentimes, self-doubt and stress, started to cultivate in me - resilience and perseverance. It hasn't always been a smooth ride. Back in 2018, I had got accepted for an internship in the Department of Psychology at Harvard University for the summer. However, it was heartbreaking when I was not able to make it there because of an administrative error in the processing of visa documents at the university’s end.

746,"I could not believe that this could ever happen and it almost took me a month to come to terms with that. With the little motivation I had left in me after all this and a lot of paranoia, I decided to pursue a research project on geothermal energy in the institute (#1). This turned out to be a game-changer, and there was no looking back! I am really grateful to my advisor, who has been supportive of whatever I do till date and has kept me motivated. I consider myself fortunate to have started my stint at research with such a wonderful person! This project turned out to be productive and took me to a couple of reputed scientific conferences in the US. I have learnt and grown immensely as a person while attending such conferences. From meeting the best scientists in the field, making new friends and connections to travel experiences, feedback on research – conferences provide an unmatched experience. It was very daunting and overwhelming for an undergrad to be thrown into an ocean and figure out the way to survive my first conference - one with 28k attendees! But at the end of that week, I was a different person! Such experiences made me realise how rewarding and humbling research can be. People are so curious to learn about each other’s work and provide constructive comments to improve your work (#2). That’s when a part of me started to decide that research is something I want to pursue further, and maybe a PhD would be a great way to go about it! My resolve was even stronger after I got back from my summer internship in Australia (#3) (my advisor there has been one of the kindest and most encouraging humans I have ever met). That is when I finally decided to apply to universities in the US and the UK for graduate studies! The first application for the Rhodes scholarship was extremely rewarding. The Rhodes scholarship is considered the world’s oldest and most prestigious scholarship. It gives one an opportunity to pursue graduate studies at the University of Oxford. With the stellar list of the past Rhodes Scholars – Bill Clinton, Tony Abbott, Michael Spence, Girish Karnad, Sanjeev Sanyal…to name a few - I thought that I wasn’t even good enough to apply in the first place! But I mustered the courage to at least apply and give it a shot so that I would never regret not applying! Just working on the personal statement taught me so much about myself. I got a sense of what I genuinely would want to do in life and most importantly, why I wanted to do something! (#4) As I anxiously waited for the results of the first round to be declared, it was a pleasant surprise to be invited for the first round of interviews in Delhi sometime in September.

747,"Having determined not to let this opportunity slip away, I was sure of devoting most of my time for the next one month for the interview. On the interview day, when I met my fellow interviewees, I felt so privileged to have made it there. Everyone was so good and (almost) perfect! They had done things I had never heard of. After a decent interview, I was relieved but told myself not to expect much since the competition was so fierce, and statistically, the chances were slim. People would say that if one clears this round, then they’re no less than a Rhodes Scholar, irrespective of the final results. With so much pressure and stress induced by waiting for ONE email, the struggle to maintain my sanity was real! Finally, after a seemingly interminable wait, I got ‘that’ email inviting me to the reception and final interview in Delhi! I could not believe it. I swear I couldn’t! I checked the email at least ten times to ensure that it was the right one! Turns out it was. This meant that I could not start my application to the universities in the US until November! I devoted even more time to prepare for this one now. I met with a lot of faculty, professionals and friends who were of great help and support to me. Fast forward to the day before the final interview in Delhi when the high-tea reception was hosted by the chairman – Mr. Gopalkrishna Gandhi (Former diplomat, Grandson of Mahatma Gandhi). I can’t really express how it felt to sit side-by-side with Mr. Gandhi, other renowned panellists and of course, my fellow finalists, 16 in all, including myself! All the other fifteen finalists were so exceptional and had done things I could never imagine doing! They were at the top of everything they did and yet so grounded. It was a humbling experience – to say the least. I already felt like a winner just for having made it there. The final interview for me didn’t go as I would have liked, and so were the final results. The five most deserving candidates were declared as the ‘Rhodes Scholars’, but I didn’t return with any regrets of not making it to the top-5. It has been, by far, the best experience I have had in my life. By this time, it was mid-November, and it was time to completely change gears and shift my focus on PhD applications to the universities in the US and wrap up my B.Tech. Project (BTP)! My BTP advisor has been very supportive and guided me to sail through both - BTP and applications. I had taken the GRE and TOEFL exams sometime in October – so did not have to worry about that ‘often-hyped’ part of the application. Thanks to a senior who calmed me down while I was fretting out on being underprepared for these tests!

748,"I ambitiously applied to 10 programs in all, 4 of which were dream schools (MIT, UC Berkeley, Stanford, and Harvard) I could hardly imagine getting into! Majority of the application deadlines ranged from Dec 1 to Dec 16 - a period of excessive outflow of money (applications are an expensive affair, but after all an investment!). Amidst all this, I could not forget that I had to prepare for an upcoming conference presentation in San Francisco, which would mean that I’d be away from Dec 5 to Dec 18. Working on the SoP was a blissful experience! I would keep mulling over each line for hours, send it for review to a great bunch of people who would always be there for me. It'd undergo edits until as late as a few minutes before the submission deadline! I learnt so much about my interests and further understood my reasons for going to grad school! There was always an irrational doubt while I submitted each application if I was good enough for that school or will I soon hear of rejection from them. I vividly remember how I spent all my days working on ""NEVER IN MY the application right until Dec 16. I would even take time-off at the LIFE DID I GET SO conference and go back to the hotel to work on my pending applications! STUCK TO MY This brings an end to the long, tiring, fretful yet exciting days of applications and marks the beginning of even more stressful and anxious waiting days. EMAILS AND Never in my life did I get so stuck to my emails and check them so CHECK THEM SO frequently. I would be more excited by the notification of an email more FREQUENTLY.I than anything else. I got into a habit of checking Gmail more frequently than any other apps! There are online forums that do a great job of adding to the WOULD BE MORE levels of anxiety – one can get to know the updates on the applications EXCITED BY THE other students around the world would post there. Just when I thought that NOTIFICATION OF I’d be able to spend the remainder of the year at peace and not worry about anything until mid-Jan, I got an email from a faculty at UC Berkeley to set up AN EMAIL MORE a time for an interview! It was a great sign for me as the year came to a close THAN ANYTHING and the interview, which was more of a cordial discussion and getting to ELSE."" know my interests better, went well. While universities would typically start sending acceptances after around mid-Jan, I got two early acceptances – one of them being UC Berkeley, which happens to be one of the four dream applications I made. All right, so - one down, three more to go! Now I was pretty relieved. However, I became a little more restless. I got into an absurd habit of checking emails in the middle of the night (which is when most of the acceptances would be sent – thanks to the time difference!). Almost for a month, this went on. After I gradually got more acceptances, I took a step further and started setting up calls with students and faculty whom I’d be interested in working with at those schools. Almost daily, my time after lectures in the evenings would be occupied with these calls. I heard back from a potential advisor at Stanford University about my case being recommended for admission on one such evening. This was totally unanticipated. THE STUDENT WHO GOT AN MIT ADMIT | PAGE 22 "
749,"He added that I should expect to hear back from the admissions committee in a couple of weeks. Just two days after this note, I was shocked to hear of my acceptance so soon! That is one of the best memories I can think of. As time progressed, I also heard of rejections from Princeton and Harvard! It, of course, felt terrible but I told myself that ‘it’s okay!’ and be satisfied with what I had. I was still waiting to hear from the most ambitious program I’d applied to – PhD + MBA at MIT… Towards the end of Feb, I began to believe that this was all and I’d soon hear back of rejections from the remaining schools. A few universities wanted to know about the attendance to their visits! ‘Visit weekend’ – as it is popularly called, is an opportunity for the prospective students to visit the university in person and learn more about the life and culture there, apart from research and facilities. I remembered seniors telling me that they are a lot of fun and totally worth attending! You’re pampered (for the first and the last time), and the schools try their best to impress you and, as a result – convince you to accept their offer of admission. If you’re wondering, these visits are usually partially funded, and in some cases – completely funded (yes!). One such visit I was fortunate to attend (before the COVID-19 took over everything) was to UC Berkeley in mid-Feb! It was indeed a great experience - a fascinating, overwhelming one! The place, weather and most importantly, its people – were just the type I would love to be with! I had almost made up my mind on attending this school once I got back (just two days before the midsems). But maybe life had other plans! Some time amidst the mid-semester exams, an interview invite was sent by MIT Sloan. I was thrilled! I replied immediately (read: desperately), confirming my availability for the same. It was the first time I was faced with a B-School interview, and there’s a world of difference between a PhD interview and this one! I had to optimize my time between this one and studying for two, rather very difficult, exams on the days to follow. A trade-off had to be made, and I chose to sacrifice my sleep for a couple of days! Thankfully it worked out well! The interview was focused on behavioural questions and discussing my experiences. I was happy with the way I handled the questions, and it was a privilege, at the least to have interviewed! Early in the morning on Holi, I get the email of my dreams. Couldn’t have been a better day to get an admit to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Naturally, everyone was elated, and it took me a few days to believe this and gradually sink into the feeling! This also meant immense confusion and added difficulty in making a choice. I was never ready for such a difficult problem but at the same time understood that it was a good decision to have to make! With my supervisor in Australia (Prof. D. Rhodri Davies) THE STUDENT WHO GOT AN MIT ADMIT | PAGE 23 "
750,"I would abstain from venturing into the process of decision making since it’s a huge problem and another story in itself – shall leave it for another day! As I come to the end of this ‘monologue’, I think it’s important to stress a bit over a couple of things I have learnt through my way. PhD is a long commitment! The next 5-6 years of your life would be spent on ‘a’ problem – going deep into the subject while learning skills that’d make you a better researcher. So if the problem is not something you genuinely care about, then five years can seem to be a very long time! Hence, it is vital to find the right reasons and motivation to attend grad school. There is nothing very sacrosanct about doing research or pursuing your interests, as it might look like at the outset of it. In my opinion, it is just about our willingness and taking that one extra step to do something. For me, research is more about the process of learning and inquiry while working towards a scientific breakthrough. (Mind you, I say this before I have started grad school – hope to share similar but more refined views even after). Venturing into different domains of creativity and intellectual thinking is exciting. If I were to give one advice – it’d be ‘Do not hesitate to ask for help and reciprocate when the time comes. People are very kind and compassionate. It is important to be one of them. It is also important to explore as many things as possible before you shut some door for yourself!’ Finally, for the applications, the key point to remember is that no one part of your application is a singular deciding factor. You can easily make up deficits in one area with a stellar performance in another! Let me sign off by expressing my heartfelt gratitude to each individual whom I have come across since I have been shaped by learning from those interactions and experiences. It would be very hard to overstate how indebted I am to my family, teachers & mentors, and friends & peers! I hope this was an enjoyable read. Wishing everyone the best of health and hope we are able to sail through these testing times very soon. Yours truly, Arjav THE STUDENT WHO GOT AN MIT ADMIT | PAGE 24 "

752,"Hello there! I am Raj Lakhani, a 3rd-year B.Tech. undergraduate in Mechanical Engineering. I am writing this piece to share my internship experience at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Starting from the third semester, I was really intrigued by the concepts involved in Fluid Mechanics and a plethora of applications that require its understanding. I also had a soft corner for Aerospace science and began to explore it through Raj Lakhani Mechanical Engineering Department Batch of 2021 IIT Bombay University Internship at CU Boulder, USA minor courses and MOOCs (during freshie year summer). I was determined to take up a research activity to channelize my curiosity and get something out of it by a “hands-on” approach. At such points, seniors can be really helpful to give you a direction; in my case, it was Rahul Agrawal!

753,"Spoke too soon! The US embassy put an administrative hold on my application as the project was in the Aerospace Department and came under “Technology Alert List”. After exactly a month, I got the J1 on my passport. This hold pushed my internship joining date to mid-June before which I “Worked from Home”. Yeah! I did that before it was cool. I was allowed to remotely access CU Boulder’s computers and work on them using VNC (Virtual Network Computing). Prof. Jansen was quite considerate of the situation and kept me engaged with goals via regular Slack meets. I finally flew to the US on 12th June, all set for my internship. Let’s talk about the work I did! The name of the project assigned to me was ‘NASA Wing-Body Junction’. So the background goes like this. NASA identified a region of separation through its studies on a German Aircraft DLR with F-6 wing configuration through experiments. Separation of flow occurs when there is an adverse pressure gradient meaning pressure opposite to the direction of flow. Of course, this is only one reason for separation. The separation that occurred in the trailing edge region of this aircraft was detrimental for the lift of the aircraft and hence the motivation to study it. Although the experimental results of this study are well established by NASA, it wanted my professor’s research group to do a computational study of it. My work was to use RANS (Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes) to model the problem. My work typically involved extracting velocity fields and pressure coefficient plots for various locations on the wing and the fuselage. The problem with RANS is that it does not accurately predict regions of separation and vortices even distantly because of the “averaging” and modeling that it does for every scale in the domain. Large Eddy Simulation (LES), on the other hand, models the very small scales of turbulence but resolves the larger scales. A Hybrid model, one which is documented in our paper, uses RANS to deal with regions where the flow is simple and LES otherwise. Direct Numerical Simulation is one that resolves all scales but is computationally intensive and may require a supercomputer to deal with seemingly simple domains. My professor and Ph.Ds under him were really cordial and helped me whenever some buggy codes stymied my work. We would have biweekly meets where we have to report our progress and discuss any issues or anomalies. I also had regular personal meets with the professor to understand the fundamental concepts behind any modus operandi during the course of the project. A short 20 minutes meeting too would be productive and enlightening. ""MY PROFESSOR AND PHD. STUDENTS UNDER HIM WERE REALLY CORDIAL AND HELPED ME WHENEVER SOME BUGGY CODES STYMIED MY WORK.""

754,"Chautauqua Trail, Colorado Rocky Mountain National Park I could attach pictures of the lab I worked in but it would show nothing else than cubicles and huge monitors! During my stay in Boulder, I lived in a shared apartment. My roommate was from UC Berkeley and he was interning at Google. Outside working hours, I spent most of my time playing ping-pong, pinball or billiards at Google’s head office with my roommate. My evenings would be accompanied by cooking (cause vegetarian, duh), video calling friends and family or playing with a pet dog ‘Willow’. Weekend mornings would mean stepping out to bike towards Chautauqua trail or Boulder reservoir or the Boulder Museum. I also exploited my “Research Scholar” ID card to go for an occasional swim or a special Hawaiian pool party. Bowling there too was discounted for university employees and it sure was fun. I also visited ISKCON temples in Denver, Dallas and Austin with my cousin Dharmik. Temple visits were really energizing and enriching. There was prasadam, kirtan, reading of The Bhagavad Gita and dance too. I was lucky to have spent the July 4 long weekend in Colorado with my cousin. We went around to see Rocky Mountain National Park, Maroon Bells and the Aspen Meadows. July 4 fireworks in the football field of CU left me spellbound. The entire sky was lit, quite literally. CU Boulder is ranked as one of the most beautiful campuses in America. I was elated when I first took a tour of the campus. It has an aesthetic backdrop of Rocky Mountain National Park and almost all campus centers have sandstone walls and red tile roofs - all in a romantic Italianate style. Words are just not enough to describe its beauty! Boulder, unlike the metros like New York or LA, has a rustic feel to it and is filled with outdoor- oriented residents. People here are fitness freaks; every now and then you will encounter a couple running or biking. My guide too cycled all his way to the campus every day from his apartment which was 8 miles away; that is a 40-minute bike ride (just to clarify, bicycles are bikes in the US). Boulder is also one of the safest cities in the US. You are more likely to get your bike (or its spare parts) stolen from the parking than getting mugged in late hours.

755,"Until this January, I was in constant touch with the professor and his research circle, especially in the winters as we were working on the paper which was presented in the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics SciTech Expo, 2020.I am grateful for this research engagement with CU Boulder; the whole process had been a roller-coaster. It was much more to me than tjust an internship though. To travel alone, to cook my own meals, to manage expenses, to meet deadlines, etc. helped me to become more responsible as an individual and better as a person. Research is difficult and it takes a lot to produce substantial results but when you do achieve it, it will be worth it! It is important that freshmen and sophomores of insti explore what research has in store for them. Most professors at IIT Bombay are happy to offer projects.

UNIVERSITY INTERNSHIP AT NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF SINGAPORE Hi, I am Ansh Khurana, Third Year Undergraduate student in Computer Science and Engineering. I was interested in research in Machine Learning and I was grateful that I got an opportunity to work on a research internship at the National University of Singapore. I developed an interest in Computer Vision techniques and their applications quite early in my time here at IIT Bombay. I tried to cover the basics on Coursera and gained hands-on experience through my ITSP project. Since most of the Computer Science internships from PT cell for second-year undergraduates are based on Algorithms/Networking/Cryptography, I tried to get an internship through apping. The apping process requires a lot of patience. You might secure your dream internship in your first 5 emails or in some cases it might take 100s of emails. I tried to work on projects in the third semester and the winter vacation that followed to build up my resume and sent out emails to professors with matching research interests. In the end, my patience was rewarded after 6 weeks of apping when I was offered an excellent research opportunity in Computer Vision at NUS. I worked there on interactive instance segmentation techniques. For example, when you need to select an object of interest in a picture in a software like Photoshop, you input some clicks on the object of interest such that it is segmented out of the background. THE STUDENT WHO WENT ON A UNIVERSITY INTERNSHIP | PAGE 30 "
757,"I worked on this problem using Fully Convolutional Networks with the objective to improve the segmentation accuracy by improving the way in which human guidance is incorporated into the network. Further, I got to hang out at a lot of fun places in Singapore. Covering almost all of the famous tourist spots like Gardens by the Bay, Singapore Merlion, Universal Studios, Marina Bay Sands and the Singapore Flyer. Staying in a foreign nation also helped improve my social skills when I got to interact with students from different countries like Switzerland, China and Egypt at the research lab. Being a vegetarian, I also had a go at cooking. Overall, the internship experience was very enriching. It was my first introduction to many different aspects of life and helped me gain invaluable experience. I got to work on real research problems which helped develop critical thinking skills and benchmarking that is behind every “novel” idea in current Deep Learning papers. The experience helped in opening further opportunities and strengthened my interest in research. I feel taking up research problems in any field is the best way to explore the subject which is ideal for identifying interests during the bachelors’ programme.

These can be done twice, starting from your 3rd semester, till the 8th semester, and counts towards the Department Electives. Another way is to interact with the senior students and the professor, they are approachable and knowledgeable in their chosen fields. The Department conducts multiple seminars and workshops each month on diverse topics spanning Swarm Robotics to Analysis of Advanced Composite Materials to Autonomous and Cyber Physical Systems. Watch out for information on these on the Department mailing list. The Department Council promotes research in the form of Lab visits where you get to visit each and every lab in the department, Know Your Department sessions, where seniors talk about their chosen field of interest within the department and Apping sessions, where seniors talk about their apping experience for higher studies in Aerospace Engineering. Feel free to contact the Department Research Coordinator if you are motivated to take up a research engagement but don’t know which professor or lab to approach. - Banzal, Aerospace Engg. DRC CIVIL ENGINEERING The Civil Engineering Department council organizes various events throughout the year like ‘Know your Department’ in which faculties introduce the students about their specializations, their research and also encourage them to take up projects. Then there are Career Counseling sessions and sessions on a Semester Exchange as well. The Civil Engineering Department has introduced a SUPERVISED LEARNING PROJECT (SLP) for UG students of the Department. This project is similar to the BTP but the only difference is that it can be taken by any 2nd, 3rd, or 4th year students, while BTPs are only allowed for the 4th year students. The SLP runs under a course code of ‘CE 695: R&D Project’. Also, this year onwards credit-based summer internships have been started. The course code for the same is 'CE346' in which 3rd- year students doing a minimum of 2 months’ summer Core-internship, can tag it as a Department Elective. We have extended this credit- based internship to University Internships as well. - Komal Gaware, Civil Engg. DRC DEPARTMENT RESEARCH ACTIVITIES | PAGE 39 "

Also, make sure you experience the one day Student Industry Visit. The main highlight of the Department, is a 6-credit department elective called 'Course on Wheels,' which is organized by Prof. Mahajani in the winter vacations. Students go on an educational tour and visit industries from various sectors such as oil and gas, base chemicals, petrochemicals, fine and specialty chemicals, etc. While a simulation project of a real-life plant is an added benefit, this is a fantastic opportunity for the 3rd year or senior students to see the real-life applications of their textbook learning. - Ashutosh Nehete, Chemical Engg. DRC COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING The Computer Science and Engineering department has a lot of active Special Reading Groups (SRGs) which are generally managed by professors and postgraduate students. Also, the department conducts a lot of interesting and informative talks, almost on a monthly basis, on a variety of topics spanning from algorithms to artificial intelligence. You can find the details of such talks on departement website. Department hosts the Faculty Unplugged Seminar Series (FUSS) which includes various workshops, seminars and talks regularly. CSE department is rich in terms of the quality and quantity of research projects going on in the departement so if you are really interested and motivated in a particular topic you should interact with the seniors or professors working with it.

With the compulsory EDL lab, you get to understand the vast area of research in Electrical Engineering and get to work on a project of your choice during the semester. The department has courses such as R&D projects which can be tagged as department electives and SRE or Student Research Exposition which is compulsory for the Dual Degree students. BTP 1 is a compulsory core course which also promotes preliminary research by every student. An industry day is organized by the department where there is collaboration with the industries to see new equipment and latest research as well. - Khanna, Electrical Engg. DRC ENERGY SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING The main highlight of the department is the symposium called Energy Day, where people from the industry come and visit the department and also see the DDP projects of students. The department being one that offers a dual degree only, every student does a DDP and hence has a good research exposure by the time they graduate. There have been many students who have pursued higher studies in the discipline as well. The department also has many industrial visits that are conducted during the semester. The DIC of the department is also a great practical exposure for all the students and you may learn to make a solar cooker too! Energy being an upcoming department, the professors focus on the practical experience for the students. Two labs in the fourth year, namely Energy Innovation Lab and the Energy Design Lab give a very good practical experience to all the student. - Siddhartha, DESE DRC DEPARTMENT RESEARCH ACTIVITIES | PAGE 41 "

The Institute is now recognized as a leader in science and engineering education worldwide. It has established a firm foundation for education and research with a vision to be the fountainhead of new ideas and innovations in technology and science. The mission of IIT Bombay is to create an ambiance in which new ideas, research and scholarship flourish and from which the leaders and innovators of tomorrow emerge."
817,"IIT Bombay on an average annually admits more than 1000 candidates for the undergraduate programmes (B.Tech./ Dual Degree and B.S.) through the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE), more than 30 candidates for B.Des. Programme through the Undergraduate Common Entrance Exam for Design (UCEED), around 300 candidates for the M.Sc. and the M.Sc. Ph.D. Dual Degree programmes, more than 1000 candidates for postgraduate programmes and around 300 candidates for Ph.D. programmes. IIT Bombay follows a credit- based semester system. There are two semesters in an academic year (Autumn: July- Nov; and Spring: January-April) during which all courses specified for various degree programmes are offered. There is one additional term during summer, called the Summer Term, for summer courses. Students are required to meet specified academic requirements each semester."
818,"This booklet provides comprehensive information on the Rules and Regulations for B.Tech., Dual Degree, B.S. and B.Des. Programmes. IIT Bombay gives freedom to its various academic units to tailor their academic programmes as per their specific needs, within the frame work of the Rules and Regulations approved by the Senate from time to time. Keeping in view the new technical developments and to allow students some freedom to explore topics of their interest, IIT Bombay revised its Undergraduate Programmes curriculum (w.e.f. the Academic Year 2013). The revised curriculum, provides additional opportunities and flexibility for students to optimize their learning experience. This needs continuous and meticulous planning of the academic profile on the part of each student to fully utilize the opportunities. The students, and parents/ guardians, are therefore, advised in their own interest to get fully familiar with the Academic system of the Institute. Student’s attention is brought particularly to the assessment procedures and the specific rules governing the grading system, academic performance requirements etc."
819,IIT Bombay offers its students best opportunities that are needed to create outstanding scientists and engineers. We hope that you will strive hard to utilize the resources available to fully develop your potential as an engineer/scientist/designer/economist/social scientist.
820,"We wish all our students a very bright future and a successful career. Dean of Academic Programmes 7 1. INTRODUCTION The B.Tech./ Dual Degree/ B.S. programmes consist of courses in basic sciences humanities and social sciences, engineering and technology and other related topics. The sequence of studies broadly consists of three phases."
821,"The first phase is an intense study of sciences, mathematics and humanities for deeper understanding of concepts than what was done in school. The second phase is the study of engineering sciences and technical arts (such as workshop, engineering graphics, etc.). This study imparts broad based knowledge in general engineering, and engineering methodologies, and enables the students to appreciate the links between science and engineering. This phase is also, by and large, common across UG programmes, and overlaps with the first phase."
822,"In the third phase, the students are exposed to subjects in their chosen areas of study, designed to train them in the methodologies of analysis of problems and synthesis of solutions. The courses cover the principles governing systems and processes, and develop the ability for physical and analytical modeling, design and development. They are also introduced to engineering practices through laboratory courses, projects, etc., and these vary from discipline to discipline."
823,"In parallel with the third phase, students can strive to broaden their perspectives through atleast two open Institute electives where they can take courses drawn from across the Institute. B.S. programme students, in addition, work independently on a project in their last two semesters."
824,"Dual Degree students do additional courses to get in-depth knowledge in their chosen disciplines, often with specializations. In addition, they work on a research and development project during their final year."
825,"At various stages of the programme, students are initiated into research methodologies, reading and interpreting research papers, use of engineering and scientific equipments/ instruments, modern computational techniques, writing technical and scientific reports and effective communication."
826,"Apart from the minimum credit requirements for the award of the degree, opportunities exists for supplementing the learning experience by crediting additional courses, in diverse areas. These additional credits, when they are in focused areas, can earn the students credentials like Minor/ Honors."
827,"The requirements for degree programmes run by the Institute are broadly classified as: a) Institute Requirements (further divided into Compulsory courses, Elective courses and other requirements). b)Departmental Requirements (further divided into Compulsory courses, Elective courses and other requirements)."
828,"The curriculum for various programmes are available on the Institute website: www.iitb.ac.in 8 1.1 Organizational Structure for Academic Administration The academic programmes of the Institute are governed by Rules and Regulations approved by the Senate from time to time. The Senate is a statutory and supreme body that governs all academic matters of the Institute, and the rulings of Senate Chairperson (Director of The Institute) are final in regard to all academic issues. A definite time schedule is set by the Senate for various academic activities, through an Academic Calendar issued at the beginning of each academic year."
829,"The Senate continuously assesses the academic programmes and makes appropriate revisions/ modifications/ improvements as and when required through two Institute level Senate sub-committees: The Undergraduate Programmes Committee (UGPC) for undergraduate programmes and a Post- Graduate Programmes Committee (PGPC) for post-graduate programmes. The Dean of Academic Programmes (Dean, AP) and the Associate Dean of Academic Programmes (Associate Dean, AP) are the Conveners & Co-conveners respectively of these committees."
830,"Similarly, the performance and evaluation related issues are monitored by the Senate through two Institute level committees: Undergraduate Academic Performance Evaluation Committee (UGAPEC) and Postgraduate Academic Performance Evaluation Committee (PGAPEC). Conveners for these committees are designated from among Senate members. These four committees make recommendations to the Senate and in turn seek/ receive opinions/ recommendations, when required, from the two Department level committees in each department, the Department Undergraduate Committee (DUGC) and the Department Postgraduate Committee (DPGC). The DUGCs and DPGCs handle all academic matters, related to both academic programmes as well as performance of individual student. The Head of the Department is the convener of both these departmental committees. The Senate as well as its sub-committees also have student representatives. Administrative backup for all academic"
831,"matters is provided by the Academic Office, with a Joint/ Deputy Registrar (Academic) as in-charge. On joining the Institute, each student is assigned a Faculty Adviser from his/her Department. Students must consult the Faculty Adviser on any matter relating to their academic performance and the courses they may take in various semesters/ summer terms. The Faculty Adviser guides the students to complete their courses of study for the required degree in a timely manner, while maintaining good academic performance."
832,"All academic issues connected with the B.Tech., Dual degree, B.S. and B.Des. programmes are handled by DUGC, UGAPEC and UGPC. If on any academic matter a student would like to approach this administrative structure, it is always through the DUGC with advice and recommendations from her /his Faculty Adviser."
833,"9 Organizational structure for Academic Matters 1.2 Academic Calendar The academic activities of the Institute are regulated by the Academic Calendar approved by the Senate, and released at the beginning of each academic year. It is mandatory for students / faculty to strictly adhere to the academic calendar for completion of academic activities. The Academic Calendar can be seen on the Academic Office website of the Institute :"
834,"(http://www.iitb.ac.in/newacadhome/toacadcalender.jsp) 2. CURRICULUM / PROGRAMME OF STUDY 2.1 Curriculum Every Department has a prescribed course structure which, is known as the Curriculum . It prescribes the courses, labs and other requirements for award of the degree and sets out the nominal sequence semester-wise. It also gives the syllabus and a list of texts and reference books for each course. The Curriculum details are updated every semester and are made available at the Institute website."
835,"2.2 Semester – Autumn, Spring, Summer The Institute follows a credit based semester system. There are two regular semesters in a year. The semester that begins in July (July to Nov.) is known as the Autumn Semester or Semester 1 and the semester that begins in January (Jan. to April/May) is known as the Spring Semester or Semester 2. During the summer vacation, i.e., (May-June), a few courses are offered as part of Summer Term (refer Sec. 4.8). These courses can be taken by students as per summer term guidelines."
836,"10 2.3. Course Credit Structure In general, a certain quantum of academic work measured in terms of credits is laid down as the requirement for a particular degree. A student earns credits by satisfactorily clearing courses/ other academic activities every semester. The credits associated with a course/ other academic activities are dependent on the number of hours of work expected to be put in by the student per week."
837,"2.3.1 Theory and Laboratory Courses Courses are broadly classified as Theory Courses and Laboratory Courses. Theory courses consist of lecture (L) and tutorial (T) hours, but may have attached practical (P) hours in special cases. Laboratory courses consist of practical hours, but may have attached tutorial hours in special cases. Credit (C) for a course is obtained by multiplying the number of hours of instruction per week in that course, by two (2) for lecture and tutorial hours, and by one (1) for laboratory hours i.e. C = 2xL + 2xT + P. A student is expected to spend, on average, one hour every week outside class for every lecture/ tutorial held that week. Two examples of credit calculation are shown below:"
838,"Theory Courses Laboratory Courses L T P C L T P C 2 1 0 6 0 1 3 5 In the Courses of Study , if a theory course is shown as, say, CE304 Soil Mechanics II: 2 1 0 6, it means that CE304 is the course code, Soil Mechanics II is the course title and 2 1 0 6 corresponds to L T P C respectively."
839,"Other academic activities consist of a Seminar, Projects, which carry credits and NSO/ NSS/ NCC, in which only a pass (PP) or no-pass (NP) grades are awarded. 2.3.2 Course Equivalence (Ref: 251 st Senate Meeting):"
840,"Addition of course equivalence for core courses will be permitted on approval of DUGC of respective Academic Units. 2.3.3 Seminars Some departments prescribe a Seminar as a requirement for B.Tech./ B.S./ B.Des. or the Dual Degree. A Seminar is a course wherein under the guidance of a faculty member a student is expected to do an in-depth study in a specialized area by doing a survey of published technical literature and understand different aspects of the problem. Finally, the results from literature must be summarized in a written report and presented before a designated committee of faculty members. Seminars typically carry 3 credits."
841,"11 2.3.4 Projects 2.3.4.1 B.Tech. Projects (BTP - I and BTP – II) Some departments prescribe Project as a requirement for the B.Tech. degree, or as a requirement for Honors (refer Sec.2.5.2), wherein under the guidance of a faculty member a student, in the sixth semester or later, is required to do innovative work with the application of knowledge gained from courses in the earlier years. The student is expected to do a survey of literature in the subject, work out a project plan and carry it out through design, analysis, experimentation etc. These projects (BTPs) may be offered as a single unit of 12 credits (BTP) or as 6 credits of BTP-I followed by BTP-II of 6 credits or 12 credits. (Ref: 241 st Senate"
842,"Meeting) Even when it is not prescribed as a minimum requirement for the degree or when not being interested in Honours, a student can opt to do a BTP as additional learning, if s/he can find suitable supervisor (s) to guide her/him."
843,2.3.4.2 B.S. Project (Ref: 240 th Senate Meeting) Some departments prescribe a B.S. Project as a requirement for the B.S. degree. Such a project is carried out under the guidelines of a faculty member and may carry 6 or more credits as prescribed by the department.
844,"2.3.4.3 Dual Degree Project (DDP) The Dual Degree Project is a mandatory requirement of the Dual Degree Programmes. The project consists of two stages, spread over fourteen months , normally starting from the summer after the eighth semester and ending with the summer after the tenth semester. These are essentially research and development projects, where a student trains under the guidance of supervisor/ s, in-depth analysis of an engineering problem and attempts synthesis of a solution. Literature survey problem analysis and problem definition extensive experimental/modeling/computational work and analysis of results typically form various components of the project work. A DDP (B.Tech.-M.Tech.) carries a total of 72 credits."
845,"2.3.4 Non-Credit Requirements 2.3.4.1 NCC / NSO / NSS One of the three activities, National Cadet Corps (NCC) or National Sports Organization (NSO) or National Social Service (NSS) is a mandatory requirement for all students for the award of a degree. These are normally conducted during evenings of week days and are designed to build character and to sensitize the students to social/ national issues. These activities carry no credits and are evaluated as Pass(PP)/ Not Pass (NP)."
846,"2.4 Minimum Credit Requirements and Planning of Individual Academic Programme (Ref: 233 rd Senate Meeting) Depending on the discipline, the minimum credits required for the award of a 12 B.Tech. / B.S. / B.Des. degree are between 266 and 282 (though the department component can be differently designed by the departments)."
847,"This is nominally divided into Basic Sciences (60 to 62), Engineering Sciences & skills (30), HSS Electives (12), Institute Electives (12), Departmental courses (152 to 168). The ""B.Tech. + M.Tech. Dual Degree programme"" should have all of the following components over and above the corresponding basic B.Tech. curriculum:"
848,a) B.Tech honors credit a minimum of 24 credits that can comprise of either only courses or a combination of courses and a Project. The Project duration can be of two semesters with a maximum of 18 credits.
849,"b) 24 credits consisting of four masters level courses. c) 72 credits of a masters' thesis spread over 14 months (e.g. summer between eighth and ninth semester, plus ninth and tenth semesters)."
850,"The credits are distributed semester-wise as shown in the Courses of Study bulletin for each department. Courses generally progress in sequences, building competencies and their positioning indicates certain academic maturity on the part of the students. Some courses do, in addition, specify passing in courses offered earlier in the programmes as pre-requisites. Students are expected to follow the semester-wise schedule of courses given in the Courses of Study bulletin; they do, however, have freedom to follow alternative schedules to optimize their academic profile with additional courses, keeping the requirements for each course in mind. For students who may have dropped mandatory courses, such rescheduling may even become necessary. Such departures from suggested schedules need to be done very carefully, and always with approval of the Faculty Adviser."
851,"2.5 Opportunities for Additional Learning: MINOR, HONOURS, ETC. : The B.Tech./ Dual Degree/ B.S. programmes recognize the fact that students’ aspirations and the demands of the work place, have become highly diverse. Every student has specific abilities, interests and career goals."
852,"Each programme prescribes the minimum credits and courses that qualify a candidate for the award of the Degree in a particular discipline. The total credits for the B.Tech. Programme, for example, vary between 266-282 depending on the discipline, as mentioned earlier. This approximately converts itself into about four theory courses and one or two laboratory courses or other activities like seminar, project, etc., every semester."
853,"The curriculum is designed to permit B.Tech., B.S. and B.Des. students, who are not identified as academically weak, to optionally take additional courses. The freedom to take about six credits every semester after the first year, permits a student to satisfy her/his interests / abilities and aspirations."
854,"It is expected that all students with reasonably good academic standing, utilize this surplus time for enhancing their academic learning experience, though the initiative is left 13 entirely to them. They can use it to credit an assortment of courses/projects anywhere in the Institute, (subject to requirements of each of these courses being met), to gain a wide exposure. These additional academic accomplishments will find a separate mention in the transcript (refer Sec.6.8.4). They can also credit courses in specific areas which can qualify as a minor/ honours. They may alternatively devote part or all of the additional time for extra- curricular activities (including social work) if they so desire, and gain hands-on administrative/ managerial/ aesthetic skills or sensitivity towards social issues."
855,"Since seats available in such additional courses are often limited and the competition severe, students aspiring to do these additional courses have to maintain high academic standing to register in these courses."
856,"2.5.1 Minor Minor is an additional credential a student may earn if s/he does 30 credits worth of additional courses in a discipline other than her/his major discipline of B.Tech. degree. All academic units in the Institute offer minors in their disciplines, and will prescribe a specific set of courses and/or projects necessary for earning a minor in that discipline."
857,"A student must pre-register for a minor course which is finally allotted on the basis of highest CPI. S/he accumulates credits by registering for the required courses, and if the requirements for a particular minor are met within the prescribed minimum time limit for the programme, the minor will be awarded. This will be mentioned in the Degree Certificate as “Bachelor of Technology in xxx with Minor in yyy.” This will also be reflected in the transcript, along with the list of courses taken."
858,"Since the number of seats available for each of the courses are often limited, one has to compete for a place in every course. If 30 credits are not completed for Minor then Minor will not be awarded. The individual course credits earned, however, will be reflected in the transcript."
859,"For the award of the minor, all requirements towards the basic degree and the minor have to be completed within the stipulated period of the programme one is registered for. The Senate in its 224 th meeting approved the proposal of allowing Dual Degree students to undertake minor courses. These rules were further modified in the 236 th meeting of the Senate."
860,"DD students of category I and II can register for minor courses from 2 nd year onwards. These students are allowed to take additional courses (within permissible credit limit) in their 9 th and 10 th Semesters, if needed to complete the minor requirement. (Ref: 239 th Senate Meeting)"
861,2.5.2 Honours Honours is an additional credential a student may earn if s/he opts for the extra 24 credits needed for this in her/his own discipline. The concerned department specifies the set of courses for earning Honours. Honours is not indicative of class.
862,"14 Students can accumulate credits by registering for Honours courses prescribed by the department. On successful accumulation of 24 credits at the end of the programme, this will be mentioned in the Degree Certificate as “Bachelor of Technology in xxx, with Honours.” This will also be reflected in the transcript, along with the list of courses taken."
863,"For the award of the honours to B.Tech. students, all requirements towards the basic degree and the honours have to be completed within the stipulated period of the programme one is registered for."
864,"Dual degrees of B.Tech. and M.Tech. intrinsically demand a deeper expertise in the major discipline of the student, and therefore Dual Degree students are required to complete the requirements for Honours, as prescribed by the department. The requirements for Honours for a Dual Degree student may be different from those prescribed for a B.Tech. student. This requirement is over and above the basic requirements for the B.Tech. degrees as prescribed by each department. The total credit requirement is therefore 266-282 (B.Tech.) + 24 (Honours) + 72 (Project) + 24 (Masters courses)."
865,"2.5.3 Two Minors etc. for Students Students in Category I, can opt for earning an additional minor (i.e. an Honour and a minor, OR if time table permits, two minors). Students should discuss this with their faculty advisers since completing two minors would involve significant overload."
866,"3. ROLE OF THE FACULTY ADVISER On joining the Institute, a student or a group of students is/are assigned to a Faculty Adviser. The students are expected to consult the Faculty Adviser on any matter relating to their academic performance and the courses they may take in various semesters. The Faculty Adviser guides the students to complete their courses of study for the required degree. For effective utilization of the opportunities for additional academic accomplishments, the planning of an individual’s academic journey needs careful consideration, and hence constant consultation with the Faculty Advisers are imperative. The Faculty Adviser is the person whom the parents/ guardians should contact for performance related issues of their wards."
867,The role of the Faculty Adviser is outlined below: a) Guide the students about the rules and regulations governing the courses of study. b) Advise the students to register for courses as per the curriculum and their academic standing.
868,c) Approve the registration of the students. d) Pay special attention to weak students and carefully monitor the performance of students recommended for the slow track option. e) Advice students on Course Adjustment / Drop during the Semester within the stipulated time frame given in the Academic calendar.
869,"f) Advice students seeking a semester drop about rules and regulations laid down for this purpose and recommend these cases to the UGAPEC through the DUGC, for 15 consideration. g) Consider and recommend to the DUGC, applications for course/ credit requirements for the students for exchange programmes. In addition, the faculty adviser converts the grades from the foreign institute to IIT Bombay as per senate approved rules."
870,"h) To ensure that students are not permitted to re-register for courses, which they have already passed. i) Inform students that grades will not be awarded for any academic activity (course/ Lab./ seminar/ project/ non credit requirement etc.) without approved registration."
871,"j) Strictly warn students that if s/he fails to register during any semester without prior approval, his/her studentship is liable to be cancelled. 4. REGISTRATION Registration at the beginning of each semester, as per the prescribed dates announced in the Academic Calendar, is mandatory for every student till s/he completes her/ his programme. If a student does not register in a particular semester without prior permission of the UGAPEC, her/his studentship is liable to be cancelled. Students are not permitted to re-register for course/ (s), which they have already passed. All students registration have to be approved by his/ her faculty Adviser. Some courses may also require instructor consent."
872,"4.1 Semester-Wise registration On joining the Institute, each student is assigned to a Faculty Adviser or an Advisory group (refer Sec.3). The student can register for courses s/he intends to take during a given semester or summer term on the basis of the programme for each discipline as given in the Curriculum and as per the advice given by his/her Faculty Adviser. The Faculty Adviser is expected to discuss with the student his/her academic performance during the previous semester and then decide the number and nature of the courses for which s/he can register during the semester within the framework of the guidelines as approved by the Senate. The Faculty Adviser may advise the student to drop one or more courses/ activities based on his/her academic performance (refer Sec. 5.1). In fact the Faculty Adviser may even advise a reduced load programme over several semesters for students with poor performance at the end of the first semester/ year."
873,"4.2 Procedure for Registrations The Institute has an online registration system and the registration is normally done on the first two days of each semester. The registration schedule is announced in the Academic Calendar. In all circumstances, registration must be completed on or before the prescribed last date for registration. Students having outstanding dues to the Institute or a hostel shall not be permitted to register."
874,"4.2.1 Online Registration The online registration process involves filling up of an online Course Registration Form 16 (CRF) stating the courses and project / seminar etc., that the student proposes to complete during that semester as per the prescribed curriculum. This should be done in consultation with the Faculty Adviser, who finally approves the registration as per permissible load (refer Sec. 5.2). Grades will not be awarded for any academic activity (course/ Lab./ seminar/ project/ non credit requirement etc.) without approved registration."
875,"4.2.2 Late Registration Only for valid reasons, late registration may be permitted till the date specified in the Academic Calendar, on payment of a late registration fee. 4.2.3 Registration for the first two semesters (except B.Des.)"
876,"In each of the first two semesters, courses common to all branches are generally offered. A student is normally required to register for all the courses listed in the curriculum for these two semesters. Students, who are identified as academically weak at the end of first semester, may be prescribed a reduced load (refer Sec. 10)."
877,"4.2.4 Registration for third and subsequent semesters The prescribed credits per semester is given in the course bulletin of the respective academic units. From the third semester onwards registration is dependent on the academic standing of the student. A student with an academic standing of Category I, II, III and IV may register for additional courses over and above the prescribed credits in the course bulletin with the approval of Faculty Adviser subject to Section 5.2 ."
878,4.3 Registration for Institute Elective Courses: An Institute Elective course can be any credit course across the Institute provided that: a. It should not be from the Academic Unit in which the student is registered.
879,b. It should not be ‘Core’ or ‘Department Elective’ course in the curriculum on the programme in which the student is registered. An Institute Elective course should be registered in consultation of Faculty Advisor.
880,"4. 4 Registration for Non-credit courses (NCC/ NSO / NSS) Non-credit requirements are assessed as Pass (PP)/ Not Pass (NP) subject to the fulfillment of the minimum requirements of these activities and a minimum of 80% attendance. One of NCC, NSO or NSS, is a mandatory requirement for the award of degree. Students are expected to complete these requirements during the first year (first two semesters). Formal registration for any one of these activities must be done along with other courses, at the beginning in the first two semesters. The choice of the activity will be done on the basis of the aptitude of the student for any one of these activities and will be decided by a committee constituted for the purpose. Once registered for one of these activities, no change will be permitted at a later stage."
881,"In addition to the above mandatory requirements, the students are permitted to take 17 NSS/NSO/NCC in subsequent years too, if they have special interest. This will be mentioned in the transcript (refer Sec.6.8.4)4.5 Registration for Projects 4.5.1 Registration for B.Tech. Projects (BTPs)Registration for B.Tech. Projects (BTPs) as specified in the curriculum, is similar to that for any other course. The details of allotment of topics, faculty supervisors etc. are specified by the concerned department before the commencement of the semester.4.5.2 Registration for Dual Degree Projects (DDPs)a) The total duration for the DDP is fourteen months. DDP consists of two stages. Credits for Stage I are 30-36 and for stage II are 36 to 42. The information about project registration, presentation/ submission/ assessment and submission of grades is given below:				"
882,Project Stage	Registration	Submission/Presentation/Assess ment to be completed during the following period	Submission of Grades to the Academic Office on or before	 Stage I	Registration for stage I will be done in January (8th Semester)– As per academic calendar	By October Month (9th Semester)– As per academic calendar	October/ November of the same year (9th Semester)– As per academic calendar

884,"b) Each Dual Degree student should have a member of the faculty as a supervisor. In addition, Co-supervisor/(s) from the same Department/ other Department / IDP Group/Centre / School may be co-opted by the supervisor with the approval of the DUGC. If the supervisor is not from the same department as the student, a co-supervisor from the Department is necessary.c) Whenever a supervisor leaves the Institute permanently/ temporarily, the DUGC shall make alternative arrangements for guidance during the supervisor’s absence.Requirements for the DDP and the evaluation procedures are given in (refer Sec. 6.4.2)18				"
885,"4.5.3 Registration for B.S. Project (Ref: 240 th Senate Meeting) Registration for B.S. Projects as specified in the curriculum, is similar to that for any other course. The details of allotment of topics, faculty supervisors etc. are specified by the concerned department before the commencement of the semester."
886,"4.6 Course Adjustment/ Dropping of courses a) The Academic Calendar sets a date, typically one week after the commencement of the semester, for Course Adjustment. On or before this date, a student is permitted to make adjustments in her/his academic load by addition or deletion of one or more courses, projects etc., provided the total credits do not exceed the bounds (refer Sec. 5.2). Course adjustment has to be done in consultation with the Faculty Adviser."
887,"b) If in the second or any of the subsequent semesters, a student finds her/his academic load too heavy, s/he may drop some courses in consultation with the Faculty Adviser, provided the minimum credit requirements (18 credits) are fulfilled. The last date for such drops is typically 20-30 days after the end of the mid-semester examination, and is set in the Academic Calendar. It is expected that the results of the mid-semester examination will be known within seven days of the end of the examination."
888,"4.7 Dropping of a Semester : a) A student may opt/be advised to drop an entire semester, with prior approval of DUGC/UGAPEC due to the following reasons: i. During a registered semester, if a student finds that s/he is unable to cope up with the studies and/or does not have sufficient exposure to most of the courses registered in that semester due to severe health problem or some other valid reasons beyond her/his control, s/he can opt to drop the entire semester, in consultation with the Faculty Adviser and with permission from the DUGC/UGAPEC ."
889,"ii. A student may seek a semester drop, due to severe personal health problem, unavoidable family commitments or other valid reasons beyond her/his control, in consultation with the Faculty Adviser and with permission from the DUGC/UGAPEC, prior to the commencement of the semester itself."
890,"b) In all cases of severe health problems, medical certificate issued by IIT Hospital is essential. If however, the medical certificate is issued by other hospitals/private practitioners, the certificates should be duly authenticated by the CMO, IIT Hospital. In all other cases, requests for dropping the semester should be accompanied by supporting documents as required."
891,c) A student will be not permitted to drop a semester after the award of DX/ II grade/(s) and/ or semester end examination. d) Such breaks from studies is typically not permitted for a continuous period in excess of one year.
892,19 e) Not registering for any semester before the last date for registration without prior approval of the UGAPEC may result in the UGAPEC recommending dropping that semester. (Ref: 240 th Senate meeting)
893,"f) Hostel accommodation and other institutional facilities will not be extended in any semester for which the student has not registered. 4.8 Registration for Additional Courses (Minor, Honors etc.): (Ref.- 236 th Senate"
894,"Meeting) Any student may register for minor or honors courses subject to satisfying the pre- requisites for the respective courses. The number of students permitted for Minor courses is to be specified before the registration date by the department, and the allocation is done on the basis of CPI. Students are permitted to register for Minor courses only during the pre- registration period ."
895,Note that there is no specific registration for Honours Courses. One accumulates the required credits during the course of the programme and the additional credential is awarded if the criteria set for them are met when the student graduates.
896,"In any semester, a student must register for at least one course component that is specified as the minimum requirement of the degree. Moreover, a student cannot overstay in the programme once the minimum requirements prescribed for the basic degree are completed."
897,4.9 Summer term Course Registration Running of courses in summer term and registration of students to these courses must follow the guidelines mentioned below: a) The course instructor/(s) should be willing to offer the course. The DUGC should recommend offering of such a summer course for consideration and approval of the Dean of Academic Programmes. The course is offered on approval of the Dean of Academic Programmes.
898,"b) The course should be offered with adequate rigor and in the same manner as a regular semester course is offered. The registration, examination and assessment, course duration and grading should adhere to the timelines in academic calendar. The total number of contact hours for the courses remains the same as that during the regular semesters, and therefore, the courses run at accelerated pace (for example 6 hours of instructions per week is expected for a 3-0-0 course) the Academic Calendar in this connection is strictly followed."
899,c) The dropping of a Summer Course is permitted within 7 days from the first lecture of the course. Fee is not refundable. d) Re-exam is permitted on the same terms and conditions like that of regular semester courses.
900,"e) Time slots will be assigned by or communicated to the Academic Office like that of regular semester courses. 20 f) A student can take up to a maximum of 24 credits of Mandatory Courses (Core + HSS + Department & Institute Electives) in which s/he has received FR/DX/DR/W grade. However, if a student accumulates two (or more) “FR” in Mandatory Courses and does not find enough courses (totaling up to 24 credits) in a summer term, s/he can take a maximum of two Mandatory Courses in which s/he has NEVER registered. (Ref: 239 th Senate"
901,Meeting - effective from Summer term 2019-20). g) Courses requiring pre-requisites need instructor’s approval in case the student has not completed the pre-requisites. (Ref: 239 th Senate Meeting - effective from Summer term 2019-20).
902,"h) NO restrictions (i.e. #f) will apply after the expiry of the regular programme duration (4 years for B.Tech, B.Des. and B.S., 5 years for DD). (Ref:239 th Senate Meeting - effective from Summer term 2019-20)."
903,i) At least 05 students should register for the summer course. The attendance record should be maintained and the minimum of 80% attendance is compulsory. The Instructors may award a “FR” grade to students who fail to adhere to 80% attendance for the summer course.
904,"j) Courses offered in a summer term will be treated as equivalent to regular semester courses for all accounting purposes. 5. SPECIAL FEATURES IN REGISTRATION The curriculum has special features that a student must be aware of while registering for courses. These include institute core courses, department core and elective courses, non- departmental courses, minor and honours options. Registration for courses depend on the academic standing of the student, as explained in this section. The registration for backlog courses and audit courses are also explained in this section."
905,"5.1 Academic Standing (Ref: 236 th Senate Meeting) Depending on the overall academic performance of a student till date, especially in the two preceding regular semesters (Autumn and Spring) in which the student had registered, the academic standing of the student is decided. A NP (not passed) grade is not counted towards failed courses in the context of determining the academic standing)."
906,"Categorization of the academic standing of a student is as follows : Category I : A student who has CPI at least 8, and no outstanding FR/DX/DR/W grade in a core course."
907,"Category II : CPI less than 8, and no outstanding FR/DX/DR/W grade in a core course. Category III (Ref: 241 st Senate Meeting) : A student who has at least one outstanding FR/DX/DR/W in core courses and at most one FR or DX grade in any other course in two preceding regular registered semesters, subject to having earned at least 18 credits in each of the semesters. These 18 credits may be earned in courses with"
908,"21 any TAG. Category IV (Ref: 241 st Senate Meeting) : A student who has at least one outstanding FR/DX/DR/W in core courses and more than one FR or DX grade in any other course in two preceding regular registered semesters, subject to having earned at least 18 credits in each of the semesters. These 18 credits may be earned in courses with any TAG. Category V : A student who has not earned at least 18 credits (in courses with any TAG) in at least one of the previous two regular registered semesters. Category VI (ARP) : Students who have accumulated FRs/DXs worth 36 credits in core courses. Note: a) Category VI supersedes all other categories. b) Students having at most 54 credits left to graduate may register for upto 54 credits on recommendation of the Faculty Adviser/ PIC(ARP) (Ref: 236 th Senate Meeting) In such cases where students have returned from semester exchange and the grades are not updated till the time of registration, the performance in the last two completed semesters at IIT Bombay may be considered for the purpose of CPI and Academic Category calculation. The same rule is also applicable in cases of semester drop. (Ref:237 th Senate Meeting) Interim Categories of the student's are calculated using the information available 24 hours before registration for the new semester begins. These categories are used for the purpose of registration for the new semester. ( Ref:248 th Senate Meeting)"
909,"5.2 Permissible Registration Load (Ref: 235 th Senate meeting) Students are allowed to register as per their academic standing subject to a maximum credit limit as given below: Academic Standing Category I Category II, III, IV Category V Category VI (ARP)"
910,"Maximum Credits Allowed 54 credits 48 credits 30 credits 24 credits The Faculty Adviser is the competent authority to approve course registration in all cases. Every student must register for a minimum of 18 credits each semester. In case a student has completed most of the minimum credit requirements, she/he may register for the remaining courses which are available in that semester, which may be less than 18 credits. The maximum credits allowed as given above cannot be exceeded under any circumstances. While these are the maximum allowed credits the Faculty Adviser may prescribe lower credits especially for Category III, IV, V and VI."
911,"22 The Dual Degree project credits will not be counted in case of permissible load.(Ref: 241 st Senate Meeting) The current limits on credits (as per the academic category) for registration purposes are applicable only for students who have not yet completed the regular duration of programme for their degree, beyond which the above restriction is waived. (w.e.f. Spring Semester 2020-21)"
912,5.3 Carrying backlogs forward Attempts are made in the programme to give an early opportunity to register again for courses in which students may have received FR/ W/ DR/ DX grade.
913,"a) The Institute core courses are expected to be offered in both the semesters, so that a student can register for a backlog course in the immediate next semester. b) For department core courses that are not possible to be offered in both semesters, the Faculty Adviser may advise the students appropriately for dropping the backlog course in favor of some other course in order to avoid a cascading effect in subsequent semesters. The Faculty Advisers and DUGCs would exercise special care and assist the students in this regard."
914,"c) Students should give priority to clear core courses that are pre-requisites for other courses in subsequent semesters. 5.4 Audit Course A student wanting just an exposure to a course, without the rigors of obtaining a letter grade, can register a course in 'Audit' mode. A course can be audited provided the course is offered in the semester as a credit course for others, and there is no slot clash. Prior permission of the Instructor is required."
915,"To complete a course in 'Audit' mode, the student has to fulfil the requirement as set by the course instructor, such as submission of assignments and minimum performances in in- semester evaluations. A course, successfully completed in 'Audit' mode, can not be considered towards the requirement of Minor or Honors."
916,"A student, on successful completion of the requirements of a course in 'Audit' mode, will be eligible for a 'AU' grade. The 'AU' grade carries zero grade point and is not included in SPI/CPI calculations. The 'AU' grade will be shown in the Transcript."
917,"In case a student fails to complete the requirements of a course, registered in 'Audit' mode, instructor will not assign any grade and the student will be de-registered from the course. The same will be deleted from the student's registration, as it will be assumed that the course has been dropped by that student."
918,"For the entire duration of the programme, a UG student can audit maximum TWO cour- ses. UG students, who are only in Category I and II, will be permitted to 'Audit' a course"
919,23 during a regular semester. 5.5 Registration for Postgraduate level courses (Ref: 235 th Senate Meeting) Undergraduate students may be permitted to register for some postgraduate level courses from fifth semester onwards with permission of the instructor and approval of the Faculty Adviser without any restrictions.
920,"5.6 Guided Study : (Ref: 240 th Senate Meeting) Guided Study is doing courses out side the curriculum in the self-study like mode, during a regular semester. A student belonging to category I may be provided the option of Guided study to acquire proficiency in an area of his/her choice, on recommendation of the Faculty Adviser/ project guide, DUGC and approval of UGAPEC. Guided Study will be available to the extent of a maximum of one course per semester with effect from the third semester, subject to a maximum of four courses in the entire programme. This option is strictly subject to the availability and willingness of the instructor offering the course. Guided Study and URA (refer Sec. 9) will not run concurrently, and the rules that govern permissible registration load apply strictly even for these courses. These courses can be considered towards Minor/ Honors, if so specified by the concerned academic unit. Registration, Examination/ Evaluation and submission of grade etc. in case of guided study will also be governed in the similar way as other courses of the curriculum."
921,"The option of guided study may also be made available, by the UGAPEC, in the following situation, on a case-by-case basis: Students who miss the ‘Departmental Introductory Course’ due to a change of branch obtained at the end of First year."
922,"5.7 Self-Study (Ref: 236 th Senate Meeting) Students can take upto two courses as self-study, after the expiry of the regular programme duration (4 years for B.Tech, B.Des, B.S. Programs, 5 years for Dual Degree) after taking necessary approval. This option is only available for completing the mandatory credits."
923,"However, for the self-study option, the following directives will be followed:- a) The registration, examination etc. will be as per academic calendar. The evaluation for self-study will be done in the similar way as is done for normal semester course ."
924,"b) Academic standards be rigorously maintained in the self-study mode. 5.8 Course Substitution In case a student obtains FR/DX grades or drops courses due to valid reason, s/he may like to substitute courses in order to complete the requirements within the stipulated duration. Following is the guideline for course substitution."
925,"a) Course substitution is not permitted for Core Courses, may it be an institute core course 24 or departmental core course. The student has to re-register the same course and complete them."
926,b) An Institute elective course may be substituted by another Institute elective course from the same group. c) A departmental elective course may be substituted by another departmental elective course from the same group
927,"6 EXAMINATION / ASSESSMENT Semester wise performance assessment of every registered student is done through various modes of examinations. These include quizzes, class tests, home assignments, group assignments, viva-voce, mid-semester examination and semester-end examination. The Instructor will announce the modes of evaluation and distribution of weightage for each of the assessments at the beginning of the course."
928,Various modes of assessment for theory and laboratory courses along with the recommended relative weightage of various components are given in this section. A large departure from the recommended modes of assessments and weightage will require prior approval from the Dean of Academic Programmes.
929,"6.1 Modes of Evaluation for Theory Courses a) Various modes of assessment used for rating students’ performance in a theory course include quizzes, class tests, home assignments, group assignments, viva- voce, mid-semester and semester-end examinations. Relative weightage for in- semester evaluations is typically between 50 and 60 per cent. This will consist of one mid-semester exam of two hours duration, of about 25-30 per cent weightage, to be held as per the schedule fixed in the Academic Calendar. Two quizzes or one quiz and one test along with assignments and viva-voce shall make up the rest of the in-semester assessment or as declared by the course instructor at the beginning of the semester The Instructor may also set aside up to a maximum of 20 per cent of the in-semester marks for attendance and/or class participation. (Ref: 235 th Senate Meeting) Make-up for any absence from in- semester evaluations like midsem/tests/quizzes will be at the discretion of the Instructor."
930,b) The semester end examination will be held as per the Academic Calendar and the weightage for this would be typically 40 to 50 per cent. It is typically of 3 hours duration and covers the full syllabus of the course. The semester- end
931,"examination is mandatory. The instructor awards an “II” grade for those students not appearing for the Semester-end examination, if they have not been awarded a DX grade for insufficient attendance. Such students are eligible for a semester-end re-examination only on medical grounds/valid reasons AND on production of medical certificate issued/authenticated by CMO, IIT Bombay"
932,"25 Hospital, or other supporting documents as the case requires. The application must be submitted to the Academic Office before the last date for registration for such re-examination announced in the Academic Calendar (refer Sec. 6.6)."
933,"c) If a student fails to appear for the re-examination too, the instructor will award “FR” grade again. If the absence in the re exam is due to medical / valid reasons, the student must submit supporting documents as mentioned above, within seven days of the scheduled date of the re-exam, to the Academic Office. UGAPEC will examine such cases and convert the “II” grade into a dropped course status (“DR”). In all other cases the “II” grade will be converted to “FR” grade. In any case the “II” grade will not be continued beyond the commencement of the subsequent semester."
934,"6.2 Modes of Evaluation for Laboratory Courses The assessment in a laboratory course will be based on turn-to-turn supervision of the student’s work, her/his performance in viva-voce examinations and group discussions, the quality of their work as prescribed through laboratory journals and a semester-end test that contains an experiment or a written examination. In-semester work will typically carry 75% and the semester-end test 25% weightage respectively. It is obligatory to maintain a laboratory journal as prescribed by the course instructor. The final examination for laboratory courses will typically be held a week before the final theory examinations. In case of absence from semester- end examination, the same rules as those for theory courses is applicable."
935,"6.3 Modes of Evaluation for Seminars Seminars are evaluated based on a written report and an oral presentation before a panel of examiners appointed by the DUGC/ coordinator. The supervisor /co-supervisor, when involved, are part of the panel. Grades carrying grade points are awarded as in the case of theory and laboratory courses based on the quality of the report and performance in the presentation. The evaluation of the seminars is completed and the grades submitted to the academic office (one week) before the commencement of the end- semester examination."
936,"6.4 Modes of Evaluation for Projects As described in section 2, B.Tech project is not an Institute requirement. However, some departments may make it as the department requirement for the degree, and some might make it only as a component of the Honors requirement, whereas for Dual Degree, the project is a required component for the award of degree. As the case may be, the separate modes of assessment are mentioned hereunder."
937,"6.4.1 B.Tech. Project B.Tech. Project may be offered as one unit as BTP, or two independent units as BTP - I and BTP - II. Wherever it is split into two units, BTP - II builds on BTP - I, and BTP - I becomes a pre- requisite for BTP – II. Departments may prescribe a minimum performance in BTP - I (which may be higher than the pass grade ‘DD’) for being eligible for BTP - II. BTP - I"
938,"26 and BTP - II are separately graded, at the end of the respective semesters. These projects are supervised, and need regular interaction (at least once a week) with the supervisor. Student has to submit a project report and defend it in front of a panel of examiners. The dates for submission of reports, the dates for presentations, and details of mode of assessment are decided by the individual departments."
939,"6.4.2 Dual Degree Projects a) The following is the schedule for the DDP assessments: i. For evaluation of DDP stage-I, the student has to submit a report to the respective department. Evaluation will be done, by a panel appointed by the DUGC/ coordinator, based on the report and (a) either an across the table discussion and viva-voce or (b) seminar presentation. The panel shall consist of the supervisor(s) and atleast one more faculty member, to act as examiners."
940,"ii. For evaluation of DDP stage-II, the student has to submit the reports to the respective departments on or before one week from the date specified in the Academic Calendar. The evaluation will be done by a Board of Examiners based on the report, and a viva-voce / presentation. Final Grade reports are to be sent by the Department to the Academic Section on completion of the viva-voce, as per the date specified in the Academic Calendar."
941,"b) The Board of Examiners for DDP assessment is approved by the Convener, DUGC, and will consist of the following: (Ref.: 159 th & 191 st Senate Meeting) For DDP Stage I"
942,(i) Supervisor(s) (ii) One Internal Examiner For DDP Stage (Final) II The Final (II) stage assessment will be done by a Board of Examiners appointed by the DPGC/IDPC consisting of the following:
943,"i. Supervisor (s) ii. Internal Examiner iii. External Examiner/Additional Internal Examiner in absence of External Examiner, if approved by the Academic Unit/Department iv. Chairperson: A Professor/ Associate Professor from another academic unit or a different specialization/ research area. The Academic Unit may decide if a Chairperson is needed for the viva or if one of the Internal Examiners can also act as a Chairperson."
944,"27 In case the Internal Examiner happens to be a Professor/ Associate Professor, he may be designated to also serve as the Chairperson with prior approval of the Convener, DPGC. a.Submission of Electronic form of Dissertation/ Report (Ref: 204 th Senate Meeting)Dissertations/ Report needs to be submitted in electronic form to the Central Library. Due academic approvals of the final version of the Dissertations/ Reports should be obtained from the supervisor(s) prior to finalizing the archival version of the Dissertation/ Report. The student shall submit the prescribed form for submission of dissertation/report to the academic unit/Academic Office, duly signed by the concerned, within ONE month, from the successful completion of the defence. If the copies of dissertation submitted after the due date, a fine of Rs. 5000/- per month from the due date of submission till the date of submission will be levied. (Amended in the 207 th Senate meeting). The final transcripts/provisional degree certificate/final degree certificate will be issued only after receipt of dissertations/reports."
945,"b. The minimum passing grade in each stage of the project assessment shall be “CC”. c. After registering for DDP (either of the stages), a student should not take up any other assignment (paid or unpaid) before submitting her/his dissertation."
946,"d. After the Dissertation is assessed, a hard bound copy of the final Dissertation along with duly completed forms is to be submitted to the Academic office. Soft copies of the Synopsis and the final Dissertation paper are to be submitted to the Central Library."
947,"The project reports need to be submitted 7-15 days before the date of evaluation, but not earlier. 6.4.3 B.S. Project (Ref: 240 th Senate Meeting) On completion of the project, student is required to submit a report and make a presentation to a committee appointed by the department which would award a letter grade."

The evaluation committee may recommend an II grade for unfinished work due to any reason. Also, if a grade is not uploaded by the academic unit by the last date for grade submission, an II grade will be automatically assigned to the student."
949,"In the case of R&D projects, BTP-1, BTP-2, DDP-1 and the first stage of the four year B.S. project and the 5 year integrated M.Sc project, a letter grade to replace the II grade must be submitted to the academic office, at most 20 days after the last date for grade submission of the previous semester. If a letter grade is not received by the academic office in time, the II grade"
950,28 will be automatically converted to an FR. No further extensions will be permitted on any grounds for these projects. The student may re-register for the project (mandatory for DDP-1) in a subsequent semester in case an FR grade (any grade less than CC for DDP-1) is assigned.
951,"For the final stage of the B.S./M.Sc project and DDP-2, a letter grade to replace the ‘II’ grade must be submitted to the academic office at most 20 days after the last date for the grade submission. However, the student may apply for an additional extension of at most 15 days (a final deadline of 35 days from the last date for grade submission of the previous semester), with recommendations and an explanation for the delay by the guide, to the DUGC of the concerned academic unit. Post assessment, the grade may then be sent to the academic office through the Convener, DUGC before this date. After this date (35 days from the last date for grade submission for project) the II grade will be automatically converted to an FR grade. The student will then have to re-register for the course in the subsequent semester after payment of fees. No further extensions will be permitted on any grounds for these projects."
952,The decision on allotment of hostel rooms during such extensions is done independently by the Dean(S.A)'s office/HCU. 6.5 Grading a) Indian Institute of Technology Bombay follows grading system. Based on the
953,"combined performance in all assessments, the student is awarded a letter grade in every course taken by him/her in a particular semester as per the curriculum. These letter grades not only indicate a qualitative assessment of the student’s performance but also carry a quantitative (numeric) equivalent called the Grade Point. The letter grades and their equivalent grade point are given below:"
954,Letter Grade Grade Point AP 10 (Grade is awarded to students with exceptional performance) AA 10 AB 9 BB 8 BC 7 CC 6 CD 5 DD 4 0 {Fail and repeat the course/ equivalent course for mandatory courses FR (except core)} FF 0 (Fail & Re-examination) {Credits are not included in CPI.

956,"DR	Dropped (DR is not a grade but only a position holder indicating that the course has been dropped and it has to be cleared in subsequent semesters).		 A student passes the course if he/she gets any grade in the range of “AP” to “DD” (“AU” in the case of an audit course, but fails if he/she gets the grade “FR” and/or “DX”. ”FF”, “II” and “DR” are place holders.b) The grade “AP” indicates exceptional performance and is awarded only in the Course/ (s) in which the number of registered students is more than 50. It should not exceed 2 % of the total strength of the particular theory or lab course. The grade “AP” is not awarded for projects / seminars.c) An “FR” grade is awarded in case/(s) where, in the opinion of the instructor (panel of examiners in the case of projects), the performance of the student is below an acceptable threshold in the in-semester and /or end-semester examinations. It may also be awarded for Academic malpractices.

If the attendance of the student, as counted with effect from the first contact hour, falls below eighty percent of the total attendance expected, the instructor may award the student, ‘Drop due to inadequate attendance’, ‘DX’ grade in that course. This ‘Drop due to inadequate attendance’ Grade would, for the purpose of CPI calculation be treated as equivalent to a ‘Course Drop’ carried out on initiation by the student. In calculating attendance, no specific concession is to be given for lack of attendance on Medical ground. Further, if a student has 80% attendance or more, he/ she cannot be awarded ‘Drop due to inadequate attendance’.Only exception to this rule is courses where the instructor has declared a prior in the first week that no DX grade will be awarded.e) For a student present in the semester-end re-examination, the instructor will award a regular performance grade (AP-FR) depending on the overall performance in the course including the re-examination.f) There are, however, a few other academic requirements for the programmes. The following two grades viz., “PP” (Pass) and “NP” (Not pass), will be awarded for NCC/NSO/NSS. No grade points are associated with these grades and performance in these courses is not taken into account in the calculation of the performance indices30			"
957,"(SPI, CPI). However, the award of the degree is subject to obtaining a “PP” (Pass) grade in all such courses. A student will be awarded “PP” (Pass) / “NP” (Not Pass) grade for NCC/ NSO/NSS in each semester provided the minimum requirement of these activities are met during that semester together with 80% minimum attendance, failing which the “NP” (Not Pass) grade will be awarded."
958,"g) (Ref: 239 th Senate Meeting- effective from End Semester Examinations of the Spring Semester 2019-20). “FF” grade can be awarded to UG students by the concerned course instructor. The students will be given only one chance for re-examination in case of FF grade, otherwise the grade will be converted to FR. Re-exam will be conducted for 50 % weightage (or same as the weightage of end-semester exam for the course). Re-exam for students with FF grade will be conducted along with medical re-exam."

Grade(s) earned in such courses will not be considered for the SPI/ CPI calculation. The transcript will record such course(s) and the corresponding grade(s) as it is/ they are. ( Applicable for NPTEL/ SWAYAM courses from the academic year 2020-2021 onwards and for Semester exchange students for academic year 2021-22 onwards.) (Ref: 246 th Sen ate Meeting)"

961,"6.7 Academic Malpractice Academic malpractices are severely dealt with. The details pertaining to Academic malpractices are available at :http://www.iitb.ac.in/newacadhome/punishments201521July.pdf 6.8 SPI/CPI 6.8.1 Semester Performance Index (SPI) The performance of a student in a semester is indicated by a number called Semester Performance Index, SPI. The SPI is the weighted average of the grade points obtained in all the courses registered by the student during the semester. For example, if a student passes five courses (Theory/labs./Projects/ Seminar etc.) in a semester with credits C1, C2, C3, C4 and C5 and her/his grade points in these courses are g1, g2, g3, g4 and g5 respectively, then her/his SPI"
962,"31 is equal to: C1g1 + C2 g2 + C3 g3 + C4 g4 + C5 g5 SPI = ---------------------------------------------------------- C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 + C5 The SPI is calculated to two decimal places. The SPI for any semester will take into consideration the FR grades awarded in that semester. For example if a student has failed in course 4, the SPI will then be computed as:"
963,C1g1 + C2 g2 + C3 g3 + C4 * ZERO+C5 g5 SPI = ------------------------------------------------------------------- C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 + C5 The courses which do not form the minimum requirement of the degrees will not be considered for calculation of the SPI. Such additional courses undertaken and the grades earned by the student will be shown separately.
964,"The updated SPIs will be shown in the transcript only after the last date of grade submission (course + project) as per the Academic Calendar. Till then, only the SPI till previous completed semesters will be displayed."
965,"6.8.2 Cumulative Performance Index(CPI) An up to date assessment of the overall performance of a student from the time s/he entered the Institute is obtained by calculating a number called the Cumulative Performance Index, CPI, in a manner similar to the calculation of SPI. The CPI therefore considers all the courses registered by the student, towards the minimum requirement of the degree s/he has enrolled for, since s/he entered the Institute. The CPI is calculated at the end of every semester to two decimal places."
966,"The CPI will reflect the failed status in case of FR grade(s), till the course(s) is/are cleared. When the course(s) is/are cleared by obtaining a pass grade on subsequent registration(s) the CPI will only reflect the new grade and not the fail grades earned earlier."
967,"Example: Up to semester r a student has registered for n courses, among which s/he has a “FR” grade in course i. The semester grade report at the end of semester r therefore will contain a CPI calculated as:"
968,"C1g1 + C2 g2 + C3 g3 + .. +Ci* ZERO+Cn gn CPI = ------------------------------------------------------------------------- C1 + C2 + C3 + ... +Ci + ... + Cn Even if a student has failed in a course more than once, the course will figure only once in the numerator as well as the denominator."
969,"32 At the end of semester r+1 s/he has registered for four more courses including the backlog course i and has cleared all the courses including the backlog course, the CPI at the end of this semester is calculated as:"
970,C1g1 + C2 g2 + C3 g3 + .. +Ci*gi+..+Cn gn CPI = -------------------------------------------------------------------- C1 + C2 + C3 + ... +Ci + ... + Cn The courses which do not form the minimum requirement of the degrees will not be considered for calculation of the basic CPI. These courses will be shown separately.
971,"The updated CPI will be shown in the transcript only after the last date of grade submission (course + project) as per the Academic Calendar. Till then, only the CPI till previous completed semesters will be displayed."
972,The Transcript will reflect only two CPI i.e. a) CPI Courses and b) CPI – Courses +Project. (Ref: 241 st Senate Meeting) 6.8.3 Semester Grade Report The Senate of IIT Bombay in its 221 st Meeting considered discontinuation of issue of Semester Grade Cards from Spring Semester 2014-15.
973,All students are able to see their grades as soon as concerned Course instructor /Faculty member uploads grades on the ASC. Students may use the data from their interface for the purpose of information and conveying to their parents as well.
974,"6.8.4 The Transcript: Consolidated Statement of Academic Performance Transcript is a consolidated statement of a Academic Performance of a student for all the semesters since joining the programme and is given to a student on successful completion of the programme along with the degree certificate. For those students who have taken multiple attempts to clear a course, the transcript given on successful completion of the programme will record the entire history of the academic performance of a student in all the courses he/she takes as a student in the Institute. Therefore every course registered by a student and the grades obtained there upon (including FR,DX,W etc.) will be mentioned in the transcript for the courses registered in the Autumn Semester 2016-17 onwards. (Ref: 225 th Senate Meeting) The transcript will reflect only two CPI i.e. a) CPI Courses and b) CPI- Courses + Project.(Ref: 241 st Senate Meeting) Additional courses will be shown separately, indicating also the minor / honors, if any, earned by the student. Additional copies of the transcript can be obtained if needed, on request and upon payment of applicable fee."
975,"Students who have not yet completed the programme can obtain an Interim Transcript, if needed, on request and upon payment of applicable fee. 6.9 Display of In-Semester Performance a) The in-semester performance of all students is communicated by the instructor to the students before the end-semester examination. Those awarded “DX” grades as described"
976,"33 in 6.5 (d) above will be clearly identified in this list. b) Based on the in-semester performance, the instructor may also decide and publish a cut- off (based on the average performance of the class), below which the in-semester performance is considered ‘Unsatisfactory’. This will be the basis on which an instructor may declare a “FR” grade even when a student is absent for the end-semester examination on valid grounds."
977,6. 10 Disclosing the Evaluated Answer scripts after Semester-End Examination A course instructor will allow students to see the evaluated answer scripts before finalization of grades. 6.11 Answer Script Retention period
978,Evaluated answer scripts are preserved by the Instructor/ Departmental Office for one semester. 6.12 Compensatory time to PwD students (Ref: 239 th Senate Meeting- effective from End Semester examination of the Autumn Semester 2019-20)
979,"Compensatory time is to be provided to all PwD students across the Institute during written examination. For PwD Students, ‘compensatory time’ will not be less than 20 minutes per hour of examination for persons who are allowed use of scribe/ reader/ lab assistant. All the candidates with benchmark disability not availing the facility of scribe may be allowed additional time of minimum of one hour for examination of 3 hours duration. In case the duration of the examination is less than an hour, then the duration of additional time will be allowed on prorata basis. Additional time will not be less then 5 minutes and will be in the multiple of 5”."
980,"PwD students must inform the instructors in advance regarding their need for compensatory time during examination. 7. Registration of NPTEL/ SWAYAM Courses: (a) A student can take maximum of 12 credits of NPTEL/SWAYAM courses in lieu of departmental elective and Institute elective courses for the regular student (not under ARP), and, (b) a maximum of 24 credits of NPTEL/SWAYAM courses in lieu of any courses including core courses for the students, who are under ARP or in extension years after the approval from DUGC of the parent department towards the partial completion of mandatory academic curriculum."
981,(b) A student can take NPTEL/SWAYAM courses as 'Additional Learning' for UG students 34 subject to not exceeding credit limit based on approval of DUGC. (Ref: 243 rd Senate Meeting) 7.1 Credit Equivalence of NPTEL/SWAYAM courses with IIT Bombay courses (249 th
982,"Senate Meeting): a. 12 Weeks NPTEL/SWAYAM courses would be typically considered equivalent to 6 credits at IIT Bombay. However, in some special cases, DUGC/DPGC/UGC/PGC may consider and approve 12 weeks NPTEL/SWAYAM course(s) equivalent to 8 credits at IIT Bombay."
983,"b. 8 Weeks NPTEL/SWAYAM courses would be considered equivalent to 4 or 3 credits at IIT Bombay, depending on approval of DUGC/DPGC/UGC/PGC. 7.2 Policy for registering/ award of grades for NPTEL/ SWAYAM/ Semester Exchange"
984,courses (Ref. 251 st Senate) i. Registration for NPTEL/ SWAYAM courses: Students may register for these courses during registration window as per Academic calendar for that semester. Faculty Advisor can approve these registrations in consultation with DUGC.
985,"ii. Registration for Semester Exchange Courses: Academic Units may register students for these courses as and when student returns from the FRN Institute, as per approval of DUGC. iii. Grading- As per Academic calendar for that semester along with other courses."
986,"iv. If no grades are allotted during the approved window, the course will be removed automatically from the registration of the students on the last date of Academic Activity, so that there will be no issue in calculating SPI/CPI of the student."
987,8 CHANGE OF BRANCH Branch change rules are effective from Academic Year 2015-16 for students admitted through JEE. Students are eligible to apply for a change of branch/ programme after completing the first two semesters and before the start of the third semester.
988,1. The Eligibility Criteria for applying for a change of branch / programme are:(Ref: 239 th Senate Meeting – effective from Autumn semester 2020-21) a) Completion of the prescribed course credits in the first two semesters. b) No FR/DX/DR/W grades at the end of the first two regular registered semesters.
989,"c) NP grade in NOCS shall not be a bar to apply for a branch change (Ref: 250 th Senate Meeting). 2. a) Before beginning the allocation, additional seats are made available in each branch, limited to a maximum of 10% of its sanctioned strength."
990,"b) While students are allotted seats of general and reserved type during admission, this data is not used during branch change. Each students of any category. available seat may be occupied by"
991,3. An eligible student's request for a shift from branch A to branch B will be considered valid if any one of the following two sets of criteria are satisfied. 35
992,Set 1 (a) the CPI of the student is at least 9 (b) there is a seat available in Branch B Set 2 (i) There is a seat available in Branch B.
993,"(ii) The strength in branch A, from which a change is being sought, does not fall below its sanctioned strength by more than 25%. (iii) There is no student with higher CPI who is currently being denied a change from any other branch X to branch B due to the strength of branch X falling below its sanctioned strength by more than 25% due to rule (ii)."
994,"Procedure Among all valid requests, a student with the highest CPI is chosen and a shift performed. If a student with CPI x is shifted from branch A to branch B then every student with CPI x with a request for branch B will be shifted to branch B, even if their request violates (ii) above. If necessary, extra seats will be created to accommodate them."
995,"Shifts as above are performed as long as there are valid requests. Note that even though a student may have been allotted a seat of lower preference earlier due to unavailability of a seat of higher preference, his/her request for the higher preference seat may become valid later because of availability of seats."
996,4. All branch transfers can be effected only once at the beginning of the second academic year. No application for change of branch during the subsequent academic years will be entertained.
997,"5. Branch change decisions will be final and will not be reversed(Ref: 250 th Senate Meeting). 9 PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS 9.1 Award of Degree On successful completion of the prescribed requirements for a programme {B.Tech.; B.S.; Dual Degree (B.Tech. and M.Tech.)}, degree will be conferred on a student in an annual convocation of the Institute."
998,"The degree certificate will indicate the relevant branch, and specializations if any, in the engineering or science discipline in which the student has graduated. For example: Bachelor of Technology in Civil Engineering, Master of Science in Chemistry, or Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering and Master of Technology in Electrical Engineering with Specialization in Microelectronics."
999,"In those cases where the student has earned the required credits for an Honors in her/his 36 discipline or a Minor in another discipline within the stipulated time, this will be mentioned in the degree certificate: for example:"
1000,1.B.Tech. in Metallurgical Engineering and Materials Science with Minor in Environmental Sciences and Engineering. 2. B.Tech. in Mechanical Engineering with Honors. 3. B.Tech. in Mechanical Engineering with Honors and Minor in Electrical Engineering.
1001,4. B.Tech. in Aerospace Engineering. For Dual Degree students 5.B.Tech. in Chemical Engineering and M.Tech. in Chemical Engineering with Specialization (if any). 6. B.Tech. In Chemical Engineering with Minor in Electrical Engineering and M.Tech. In Chemical Engineering with Specialization (if any).
1002,"Along with the degree certificate, the student will be given a complimentary copy of transcript, giving semester-wise details of all academic accomplishments. The additional courses taken, whether earning a minor/ honors or not, will be separately mentioned in the transcript. If an honors/ minor is earned that will also be mentioned. An overall CPI for all the academic work done by the student will be given. The transcript and the final degree certificate will not mention any class whatsoever; only the CPI/s will be given in the transcript. Honors is not indicative of class."
1003,"For conferment of degree, student has to fulfill the following requirements: a) The student should have taken and passed all the courses prescribed for the degree under the general institutional and departmental requirements."
1004,"b) The student should have satisfactorily fulfilled other academic requirements such as practical training, NSS/NSO/NCC, work visits, seminar and projects, as specified for the discipline/programme. c) The student should have paid all the Institute dues. d) The student should have no case of indiscipline pending against him/her."
1005,"9.2 Award of Medals The rules and procedures for the Institute Medals including Department silver medals, PGM (President of India Medal) and Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma Gold Medal. (Ref: 229 th Senate Meeting)- to be implemented for award of Medal from 55 th Convocation."
1006,"a) Eligibility for award of PGM, IGM and ISM (for UG), shall be highest CPI based on the mandatory courses for B.Tech./B.S. with Honors. b) For DD (B.Tech.+M.Tech.), the students of a particular Department shall be competing with the students of 4 year B.Tech. of their Department admitted together. And therefore, their CPI at the end of 4 th year shall be taken into consideration."
1007,"37 c) Tie breaking rule shall be as follows : i. In case of tie in CPI for the President of India Medal (PGM) & Institute Gold Medal (IGM), the CPI across all courses taken (including additional and minor courses) up to end of 4 th year will be used to break the tie."
1008,ii. In case of tie in the CPI for award of Silver Medals equal number of medals will be given. Guidelines for award of Institute Medals: (Ref: 234 th Senate Meeting)
1009,"A student will be considered for the medals, if the student has obtained overall CPI 9.0 or above (including MTPs). The grade of “II” on medical ground and/or “W” in a course shall not be the bar."
1010,"Following shall be considered a disqualification for award of Medals: a) The award of “DX” or “FF”or “FR” grade(s) in a course (of any tag ie. Core, Elective, Additional Learning, etc.)"
1011,b) Extension for final stage MTPs. c) Any punishment under DAC/ADAC during the programme. (The names of the proposed medalist be verified from the Dean (SA) office for any DAC punishment)
1012,d) A semester drop. NPTEL/ SWAYAM and or Semester exchange course(s). a) The students taking up courses outside IIT Bombay by means of NPTEL/ SWAYAM and or Semeter exchange shall be eligible for the award of Medals and Prizes. (Ref: 246 th Senate Meeting)
1013,"9.3 Transfer to ARP : (Ref: 240 th Senate Meeting) Given that some of the best talents in the country take admission at this Institute, it is expected that all of them perform very well, and fully utilize the various opportunities provided for their academic advancement. However, in a few cases, students are unable to cope with the studies here. This may often be due to a lack of aptitude or a mismatch between the student’s interest and what the programmes provide. Early recognition of this tendency permits corrective action to be taken in time, and the students to pursue their careers elsewhere. The students with poor Academic performance are transferred to the Academic Rehabilitation programe(ARP) (Ref. Sec 10)"
1014,"9.4 Early exit for poorly performing Dual Degree Students Early exits for poorly performing Dual Degree students is permitted after the ninth semester, if the CPI upto that point is below 5.00. A few students in the Dual Degree Programmes indicate inability/ disinclination to complete the Dual Degree Programme for various reasons and seek an exit with only a B.Tech. Degree. This is also what the supervisors/"
1015,"38 faculty advisers recommend based on their observation of the student. If a given department/ academic unit, through deliberation in the DUGC, finds that a particular student, irrespective of academic performance, is unlikely to complete the requirements of the Dual Degree (B. Tech. + M. Tech.) satisfactorily then it may recommend to the UGAPEC that the student be permitted to exit with only the B. Tech. Degree but with the following mandatory clauses:"
1016,a) The academic requirements of the B. Tech. Degree must be completed. b) The student shall exit only after the ninth semester of the programme meaning that there is at least one semester of time penalty imposed for this exit. (this penalty is applicable even to date).
1017,"c) The student shall be awarded only the B. Tech. Degree and not Honours or Minor(s). d) The transcript given to the student along with the degree would mention that the student had been admitted to the Dual Degree Programme, but was awarded a B. Tech. Degree as an exit option, due to inability to complete the Dual Degree Programme. The degree would not mention anything of the kind."
1018,"10 UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH AWARDS (URA) Some students may have an inclination towards research. The Undergraduate Research Awards (URA) is designed for such students. URA will be available at three levels, all of them independent of each other. They will carry codes similar to course codes so that they can be listed in grade reports."
1019,"URA01 : for preliminary research/ developmental experience URA02 : for B. Tech. Level Research Project. URA03 : for Dual Degree Level Research Project URA01: This is a recognition of a small research/ developmental effort, successfully completed by a student in the first, second or third year of an undergraduate programme – that is, a B.Tech., B.S. or a Dual Degree Programme. A faculty member must agree to supervise the student for the URA01 project. The student works with this faculty member, with the approval of the DUGC, for four-to-six month duration – including the summer or winter vacations. No formal registration is required with the academic office at this stage. If the faculty member is satisfied with the quantum and quality of work done, at any stage, s/he may recommend the award of URA01 to the student, which will then be listed in the transcript of the student in the semester immediately following the semester in which this award was recommended. No credits are assigned to URA01. URA01 can be awarded only once to a student. The grade for URA01 will be”PP”."
1020,"URA02: This is to be treated as recognition of truly exceptional work, both in quality and in extent, done in the B.Tech. Project. If the committee evaluating the B.Tech. Project of a B.Tech. student believes that the student has carried out truly exceptional work in the B.Tech. Project and the quantum of work is substantially higher than what is expected, it may"
1021,"39 recommend that two more faculty members, other than those who already participated in the committee for evaluation, duly chosen by the DUGC, examine the work done and evaluate whether a URA02 can be awarded to the student in addition to the AA grade already given. A joint recommendation must then be made by all: the original committee of evaluation and these two other faculty members that this student be awarded URA02, duly routed through the Convener, DUGC to the Convener, UGAPEC. This award, on approval by the UGAPEC, will be mentioned on the grade report of the student as URA02 carrying six credits and the grade AA. No formal registration is required with the academic office. The advantage to the student would be that his / her CPI would improve, given that these credits are with an AA grade.

A joint recommendation must then be made by all: the original committee of evaluation and these two other faculty members that this student be awarded URA03, duly routed through the Convener, DUGC to the Convener, UGAPEC. This award, on approval by the UGAPEC, will be mentioned on the grade report of the student as URA03 carrying six credits and the grade AA.

1106,Mapping of grades for exchange students (Approved in 233 rd meeting of the Senate held on 25/04/2018). IITB uses letter grades on a 4­10 scale. The following proposal outlines a scheme to map grades from other numeric or letter grades to the IITB scale.
1107,"Mapping from a numeric range: Suppose a University provides a numeric range [L, H] where L is the lowest passing mark and H is the highest passing mark. Compute constants a and b such that aL+b = 4 and aH + b = 10. That is a = 6/(H­L). And b = (4H­10L)/(H­L). For any numeric score x, the numeric grade in the IITB system is computed as floor{ax+b}."
1108,"Comparison with the earlier UGPC ruling: The earlier UGPC document only gives a formula for the ranges [1,4] and [1,5]. For the [1,5] scale, this proposal coincides with the earlier ruling. However for the [1,4] scale the earlier UGPC ruling proposed floor{ax+b+0.5}. Note that even in this case, the result is the same for integral and half­integral values of x,like 1,1.5,2,2.5 etc."
1109,"Mapping for letter grades. If the University does not provide a numeric grade and only provides letter grades then the following map be considered. We first map letter grades as given below to a numeric range and then use this numeric range to compute the grades. The lowest letter grade is mapped to the number 1. The next is mapped to 1.5. Every letter grade is mapped to 0.5 plus the number mapped by the previous letter grade. Note that if the University provides both letter grades and numeric equivalents, the numeric equivalent will be used."
1110,Fail grades are mapped to zero.
1111,"Like most of the engineering colleges IIT Bombay also follows Grade Point system here which is known as CPI system (Cumulative Performance Index). For every course taken by the students, he/she is assigned a letter grade on his/her combined performance in all the assessments. These grades are described by the following letters and corresponding grade points."
1112,Letter Grade	Grade Point	Letter Grade	Grade Point	 AP	10	FR **	0/Fail (Repeat the course)	 AA	10	DX ***	Fail due to lack of attendance	 AB	9	II #	Incomplete	
1113,BB	8	DR	Dropped	 BC	7	PP	Passed	 CC	6	NP	Not Passed	 CD	5	AU ##	Audit	 DD *	4			 *DD Grade Minimum passing grade in a course is DD.
1114,"**FR Grade The letter grades FF and FR shall be treated as failure grades. FR grade will be awarded in cases where in the opinion of the instructor, the student hasn't had adequate academic exposure to the course and should therefore repeat the course. FR grade may also be awarded in cases of minor malpractice in examinations/assessments. A student, whose in-semester performance is very poor, may be awarded the ‘FR' grade by the instructors, even if he/she had missed the end-semester examination due to any reasons. If a student either does not submit his seminar report by the prescribed date or he/she is absent for presentation on the scheduled date he/she shall be awarded FF grade unless he/she is given extension by the coordinator under exceptional circumstances. Re-examination may be permitted for a course if he/she obtains FF grade. After such re-examination if the student passes in that course, he/she will be awarded the maximum grade of DD in that course. If a student does not take or fails in the re-examination, he/she will be awarded the grade FR. A student getting a FR grade has to re-register for the same course if it is a core subject. If this course is an elective course, he/she may register for an alternative course as prescribed by the DPGC/ IDPC/SPGC, without this being counted as an additional courses."
1115,***DX Grade The grade DX in a course is awarded if a student does not maintain the attendance requirement in the Lecture/Tutorial classes. The DX grades may also be awarded to the students having bad or incomplete in-semester records on non-medical reasons. The DX grade will be declared in the first week of November for the Autumn Semester Courses and in the first week of April for Spring Semester Courses (in general one week before the semester end exams). A student with DX grade in a given course is not permitted to take
1116,the semester-end examination in that course. She/he is also not eligible for 50% marks re-examination in that course. Such a student has to re-register for the same course whenever offered. DX Given to students with attendance shortage. This does not count in the SPI / CPI. However it will be counted as a backlog.
1117,"# Incomplete Grade (II) Grade 'II' is awarded in a lecture/lab course if a student has satisfactory in-semester performance, but has not appeared for the end-semester examination on medical grounds. The student is entitled for 50 marks re-examination given at the end of the particular semester. ‘II' grade will be converted into a performance grade (depending on the overall performance in the course) after the re-examination."
1118,"##Audit Grade (AU) The student registered for a course as audit shall be awarded the grade AU if they fulfill the requirement of minimum of 80% attendance and duly satisfactory in-semester performance as prescribed by the Instructor. The Instructor shall include such AU grades in the final grade report for that course. If the student does not qualify for the grade AU, it will be assumed that the course has been dropped by that student."
1119,"Dropping of course(s) If any student finds his course load to be too heavy then he can drop one or more of his courses within a stipulated time. Even the core courses can also be dropped in condition of that he she/he will complete the dropped course(s) within his degree tenure. In case of electives the student need not to take the same courses, she/he can select any other elective(s) as well. Such courses will appear in the transcripts and final grade card with a 'W' grade (withdrawn grade). These courses will have no impact on SPI/CPI. The last date for dropping a course by the student will be two weeks after the midsemester examination for the semester-long courses and one week after the mid-semester examination for the half-semester courses. The last date for course drop will be included in the Academic Calendar."
1120,"Grade Improvement 1. A student in a PG Programme, where minimum CPI for coursework is 6.0, will be eligible for repeating a course for grade improvement if he/ she has a CPI less than 6.0 and has been permitted by PGAPEC to continue in the Programme on Academic Probation."
1121,"2. For Grade improvement, a student has to re-register in the course in a subsequent semester if the course is offered. The grade obtained in the re-registered course will supersede the earlier grade and the same will be reflected in the Semester Grade Card and in the Final Transcript."
1122,3. The student can avail this option only for TWO courses in the entire programme and only ONCE for a specific course.

1174,"   SSO has become mandatory for all the network users at IITB.  Before starting to use new SSO based services, everyone needs to register their smartphones for two-factor authentication. Please note this is a one- time activity. "
1175,"Those who are using two accounts, i.e., one personal and another functional/institutional (e.g., username@iitb.ac.in and stores.department@iitb.ac.in) accounts, you need to register for both the accounts.     **Methods for SSO 2FA registration:**  Computer Centre recommends registering for at least two methods of Two Factor Authentication. So that in case of unavailability of the primary 2FA method, you can use the alternate registered method and will not get locked or barred from using SSO based services. "
1176,"For example, along with the authenticator app or TOTP based OTP, users can register their mobile number using the same SSO interface for SMS based OTP. This SMS based OTP could be used to login to SSO in case if you lost your phone or facing any software/hardware issue with the smartphone and to repeat the TOTP registration process with a new device. "

1197,"   **SSO & Two Factor Authentication (2FA) related FAQ's**  #####  SSO & 2FA related FAQ's  ![](/assets/icons/Plus.svg)    1. **What is 2FA?**  Two/Multi-Factor Authentication (2/MFA) combines two or more independent credentials to gain access to a system. These credentials include something the user knows (e.g., password), something the user has (e.g., token device/smart card/smartphone) or something the user is (e.g., biometric verification). "
1198,"The goal of 2FA is to create a multi-layered approach that makes it difficult for any unauthorized person to gain access to a system. If one factor is compromised, such as a password, the attacker will still need the other factor, for example, a smartphone in order to gain access to the system. "
1199,"  2. **Do I need to enroll or register in 2FA for accessing IT Services?**  All IITB faculty, staff, students, workers, and others with an active appointment at and with a valid LDAP ID need to enroll in CC'S SSO 2FA. "
1200,"  3. **What if I don't enroll in 2FA?**  You will not be able to access any web applications using your LDAP Login ID until you've enrolled. To learn how to register in 2FA now, refer the above registration tab "
1201,"  4. **What if I uninstalled the Google/Microsoft Authenticator Mobile app?**  If you have registered an alternate 2FA method then, you can authorize your logins using those methods and after login you can deregister the old device. "
1202,"If the smartphone is the only option, then kindly contact CC's helpdesk. We will help you out with the deregistration of your old device. Also, soon we will provide a dedicated interface on CC's website for this. "

"
1204,"  6. **Help, I've Lost or Broken My Phone, and Now I Can't log in?**  If you have registered an alternate 2FA method then, you can authorize your logins using those methods. If you do not have access to your alternative method, and your only 2FA device was lost, broken, stolen, etc., please contact the CC's Helpdesk either by raising a ticket on <https://help- cc.iitb.ac.in> or by calling our helpdesk number 2677. "
1205,"  7. **How does changing my SIM card, phone, and/or phone number affect the Google/Microsoft Authenticator Mobile app?**  **Changing the SIM Card** : If you change your SIM card and do not change your phone number, the Google / Microsoft authenticator Mobile app, IITB SSO app, and SMS options should continue to remain functional for your phone.

1214,"Currently, there is an upper limit on number of SMS used for OTP by per user per month. (30SMS/user/month)    10. **What if I changed my user ID from roll/employee number to something else?** "
1215,We have already taken care of all the things necessary to handle this change. Any kind of additional action is not required from user side. Even there is no need to new registration for Time-based OTP (authenticator app). 
1216,"Every 6 hours (00, 06, 12, 18 hours), this change will also getting pushed to G Suite and Office365. So users may face temporary unavailability of G Suite or Office365 services between this period after change of his/her user id. "
1217,  11. **What is the session / logout period.**  SSO doesn’t control or enforce other session timeout for application. Each application is having its own timeout period. For e.g. internet.iitb is having timeout of 30 minutes. G Suite or Office365 has timeout period of more than a year. 
1218,SSO’s itself having its own timeout of 15 minutes if you have not checked the check box called “Remember me”. If you have checked this “remember me” check box then the timeout of SSO will be of 15 days. During this period SSO will not ask your credentials and OTP. 
1219,  12. **Use of multiple accounts with IITB SSO.**  SSO support simultaneous login with multiple accounts. But it also depend on each and every application. All applications doesn’t support multi-sessions login or some application only works on IP address level like internet.iitb. 
1220,"Applications like Google Drive, Google Meet, Microsoft One Drive support multiple logins in a same browser. You just need to switch the account from that application. But applications like webmail who doesn’t support multiple logins, you just need to click on logout button/link then our SSO will provide you the option to switch the account. "
1221,  13. **Help! I have registerd for SMS based authentication but not receiving SMS**  Please note each user can avail a maximum of 30 SMS per month for OTP. Computer Centre does not recommend using SMS based OTP as your Primary 2FA service. 
1222,"If you have registered an alternate 2FA method then, you can authorize your logins using those methods.  If SMS based OTP is the only option, then kindly contact CC's helpdesk. We will help you out with the deregistration of your old device. Also, soon we will provide a dedicated interface on CC's website for this. "
1223,"  14. **Use of a shared account with SSO**  There are some functionary or institutional accounts that might need to be used by more than one person. In such cases doing 2-factor authentications is a bit challenging. At the same time, 2FA is compulsory for all the SSO based services. The 2FA methods like Time-based and SMS based OTP do not support sharing. As of now, there are two solutions for this, as given below. "
1224,"    * **The use of hardware-based 2FA method:** To do a hardware-based 2FA, you require a USB security key that the user/department/section/centers need to purchase. Security keys can be purchased online or through any computer/IT products vendor. While buying these keys, Please make sure that the key should be webauthn/FIDO2 certified. "
1225,"Each user needs to register his/her security key with the shared account using the SSO interface. The detailed step-wise how-to for this is available on this page under the title ""Hardware-based 2-Factor Authentication"". "
1226,"    * **The use of Password-less authentication:** To use this method, the primary owner of the shared account must have registered for Time based or SMS based OTP. Rest all user needs to install the “IITB SSO” app on their smartphone. The detailed step-wise how-to for this is available on this page under the title ""Passwordless Authentication."" "

1293,   4) In case of servers :  It has been observed that most of the servers are non windows based servers but in case if there are any windows based servers you need to change the IP address of the server according to the information above. 
1294,For example :  Valid IP address for non-windows based server : 10.102.2.1   Valid IP address for windows based server : 10.102.220.1  * * *     In any case gateway and subnet mask need to be changed according to the information above. 
1295,"Please note that there is no change in DNS entry so DNS will remain same , DNS : 10.200.1.11  Please note that when the IP's (machines/servers) which are listed in the DNS, are changed we also need to change the entries in the DNS correspondingly. So we request you to provide us the consolidated information of the changed IP's. "

1330,"[ Calculation of SPI and CPI  Suppose in a given semester a student has taken four courses having credits C1, C2, C3 and C4 and grade points in those courses are G1, G2, G3 and G4 respectively. Then,     "
1331,SPI = (C1 x G1 + C2 x G2 + C3 x G3 + C4 x G4) / (C1 + C2 + C3 + C4) CPI = (SPI1 x Credits in semester1 + SPI2 x Credits in semester2 + ...) / (Total credits)     
1332,"For example, if in a given semester a student has taken four courses having credits 6, 6, 8, and 6 and grade points in those courses are 10, 9, 8, 6 respectively. Then, SPI = (6 x 10 + 6 x 9 + 8 x 8 + 8 x 6) / (6 + 6 + 8 + 6) = 7.62     "
1333,"If the student has an SPI of 7.62 in the 1st semester worth (say) 32 credits and 8.2 in the next semester worth 36 credits, CPI (at the end of 2nd semester) = (7.62 x 32 + 8.2 x 36) / (32 + 36) = 7.93     "
1334,"Do note that all semesters have more or less equal credit weightage, so it is important to do well throughout, and not just in final exams, in order to maintain a good CPI.     "
1335,"Grading  The system of grading here, in most courses, is relative. The highest grade (worth 10 points) is set according to the highest score obtained in the class, and proportionately, grades are allotted to all students. Grading, in integral values out of 10 is done based on the student’s performance throughout the semester and goes from 10 to 4 (AA-10, AB-9, BB-8, BC-7, CC-6, CD-5, DD-4).     "
1336,Detailed rules can be found in the ‘Rules and Regulations’ booklet which you will receive subsequently. Parents and students are requested to go through and understand it carefully.  ] 
1337,[ Students are eligible to apply for a change of branch/programme after completing the first two semesters and before the start of the third semester.      1. The Eligibility Criteria for applying for a change of branch / programme are:    
1338,"    1. Completion of the prescribed course credits in the first two semesters      2. No backlog at the end of the first year    2.     1. Before beginning the allocation, additional seats are made available in each branch, limited to a maximum of 10% of its sanctioned strength      2. While students are allotted seats of general and reserved type during admission, this data is not used during branch change. Each available seat may be occupied by students of any category.    3. An eligible student's request for a shift from branch A to branch B will be considered valid if any one of the following two sets of criteria are satisfied.    Set 1 "
1339,"    1. The CPI of the student is at least 9      2. There is a seat available in Branch B  Set 2      1. There is a seat available in Branch B      2. The strength in branch A, from which a change is being sought, does not fall below its sanctioned strength by more than 25%.      3. There is no student with higher CPI who is currently being denied a change of branch to “B” due to rule (ii) Procedure Among all valid requests, a student with the highest CPI is chosen and a shift performed. If a student with CPI x is shifted from branch A to branch B then every student with CPI x with a request for branch B will be shifted to branch B, even if their request violates (ii) above. If necessary, extra seats will be created to accommodate them. Shifts as above are performed as long as there are valid requests. Note that even though a student may have been allotted a seat of lower preference earlier due to unavailability of a seat of higher preference, his/her request for the higher preference seat may become valid later because of availability of seats.    4. All branch transfers can be effected only once at the beginning of the second academic year. No application for change of branch during the subsequent academic years will be entertained.    5. Students may be permitted to change from B.Tech. to Dual Degree Programme in the same department at the end of third and fourth semesters subject to the department’s recommendations.  "

1341,[ IIT Bombay offers an interesting opportunity under the Interdisciplinary Dual Degree Programme. Students interested in pursuing a Masters in a department different from their undergraduate parent department can avail the option of doing so towards the end of their 3rd year.     
1342,"All BS, Btech or Dual Degree students can convert from their 4-year undergraduate degree into a 5-year Undergraduate + Masters degree. IDDDP is offered in several departments including Data Science and Management (under Shailesh Mehta School of Management) to name a few.

"
1345,IIT Bombay provides you with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to study abroad at universities across the globe while you’re still a student here. The institute has partnerships with a multitude of universities as part of which you can spend up to two semesters there taking up courses which you would otherwise have to finish at IIT Bombay. Another advantage? You don’t need to pay the humongous tuition fees at the foreign university!     
1346,"Semester exchanges are often a life changing experience, and the perfect way to immerse yourself into a completely different culture. You get to live as a local in a new country for four months and party like you’ve never done before.

Although for some of you, it might seem a little difficult to adjust to at first, you will soon fall in love with your new home. You can find some more information in the section on Hostels.     "
1349,"As the hostels are within the campus, your entire life will be usually contained in the campus itself with the occasional outings in search of good food or for treats. Consequently, the campus is well fitted to address all of your needs, be it your daily necessities or your health. We also have a couple of guesthouses which you can avail of (probably) in case you have someone coming over to visit.     "

1352,Throughout your course here in IITB you might need various stuff from everyday items like toothpaste and soap to books for subjects. Oftentimes you would also want to detach yourself from your hectic schedule and go visit a restaurant or watch a movie. It is therefore a good idea to familiarize yourself with the various shops and places within the campus and outside it.     
1353,"Stationery and Xerox  Every Hostel has a xerox shop which is normally well equipped to handle basic stationery needs. If you don’t find something in your own hostel, you should most probably find it in the neighbouring hostel. Hostel 12 shop is the best stocked, in that regard. Most hostel xerox shops start at around 10 am and close by 9 pm. Hostel 5 shop is open till a little later (10 pm). If you are closer to the academic area, you can visit the shop in the Main Building on the ground floor, right opposite the library for notebooks, lab coats, bags, lab files, xerox, print out, and most other stationery items. During midsems and endsems, xerox shop timings for some hostels are extended.     "
1354,"Books  For buying books, we have a shop called Book World on campus on the ground floor of the Gulmohar Building where you can get discounts on course-related books. Alternatively, you could go to “Popular Book Store” at YP Gate. You can also buy second-hand books from the Jay Ambe bookshop in the lane right opposite Main Gate, next to Mahavir. He also accepts books back at the end of the semester at half the price at which they were bought.     "
1355,"Daily needs  For the most basic of amenities such as toothpaste, toothbrush, pens, soaps, and other such items (which one should use daily), one can go to the hostel Xerox shop itself. Another alternative would be the Hostel 12 shop which stocks almost everything one would need and more- from slippers to stationery to biscuits and towels, with servings of Computer RAM and MP3 Players on the side. One can also go to Haiko or D-Mart in the Hiranandani Complex for these. Alternatively, the shopping complex at the Y-Point Gate can also take care of most of your needs. The YP market has a post office, a dry cleaner and a tailor as well, just in case.     "
1356,"Cellphone connections and credit  Sim card stalls of different operators are set up in the campus during the first week of the academic year. It is also a good idea to check out all the schemes available for different connections before settling on a cellphone service provider. Otherwise Airtel and Vodafone connections are easily available at Main Gate. Reliance has a store in Hiranandani near Subway. Vodafone has a store near the Delphi Building (next to the Cafe Coffee Day outlet). In case of prepaid connections, you need to submit a photo ID card and documents to prove that your address is what you have written in the form. If you do not do it within 2-3 days of buying the SIM, it will be disconnected. If you need passport sized photos for any forms (you should always keep some handy) you can go to the Navrang Photo Studio (Galleria) or the one right opposite Main Gate and get them clicked. For recharging your cell phone credit account you can visit your hostel shop. H3, H8 and H12 in particular have shops where you can get almost all kinds of top-ups or recharge cards. Alternatively, if you have a debit card, you could also recharge your account online.     "
1357,"Banks and ATMs  Two major banks operate inside IITB: Canara Bank and SBI. The Canara bank branch is located on the first floor of the Gulmohar building. There are two Canara bank ATMs inside the campus. One is located on the ground floor of the Gulmohar building, while the other is located opposite hostel 7. There are two SBI ATMs as well. One is located between Hostel 5 and Tansa, while the other is right outside the main gate. On the orientation day, both banks set up temporary stalls in the lecture hall complex to ensure a smooth and hassle- free opening of accounts. Debit cards are provided on the spot as well.     "
1358,"Restaurants and Eateries    1. Hostel Canteens: Every hostel has its own canteen, which is for most people, the go-to place for inexpensive food. Whether for a quick meal, a refreshing soft drink or a coffee when you’re up studying late, hostel canteens are the way to go! Hostel 12 offers a night canteen, with some excellent food.    2. Eateries within the institute:      1. Brews and Bites: Located in Hostel-8, it is popular for its pizzas, frappes and pastries among other things.

Theme Parks: In Mumbai, there are a number of good amusement and water parks such as Water Kingdom, Snow World and Essel World. Adlabs Imagica and AquaMagica may be a little further away and more expensive than the others, but they rank among the best theme parks in the country.    5. Gaming Arcades: Several malls have arcade gaming zones and bowling like the R-City Mall, Ghatkopar. Hakone(Hiranandani) offers opportunities for Go-Karting and Paintball.    6.

Otherwise you can take the evening off, and watch the sunset at the beach while sipping naariyal paani.  "
1362,"A certain obscure site called BookMyShow sells tickets to just about any event you may want to attend.      Public Transport @ IITB    1. Cycling: One may say that they are a popular mode of transportation considering the number of cycles parked outside the hostels. However, their frequency of use often decays exponentially. But it is entirely up to you! Cycling is a quick, eco-friendly and fun way to get from point to point in the institute. Remember that maintenance of your cycle is crucial, especially in Mumbai’s rainy weather. There are two cycle repair shops on campus, one at the Market Gate and the other next to H5. A sturdy lock is also a good investment.    2. Walking: Alumni often reminisce about the good times they had walking to the lecture halls, amongst good company and pristine greenery. It may not always be possible, but when you have the luxury of time, make the most of it!    3. Auto-rickshaws: Auto-rickshaws are fairly common in the institute and are used for traveling both within and outside the institute. There have been issues of rickshaws refusing to go to destinations outside, though there have been measures taken to curb this.    4. Taxis: Whether while traveling in a group, or when needing a drop to the airport, Uber and Ola have made traveling in comfort easy and economical.  "
1363,",  Hostel Allocation  Room allotment for first year students are done in following manner :      For Boys - They will be allotted 2 wings of hostel 15 and a wing in hostel 16. On each floor, there are three subsections (also called wings!) - each wing has 6 rooms, each of which will be shared by 2 students.

1365,"Hostel/Room Change  The procedure of shifting rooms basically goes through the warden of the hostel through a written application citing the reasons for the change. It will be a great experience to have a new guy as a roommate which will eventually help you in making new friends which you'll cherish for your life. Though, definitely if both of you agree, it will make things easier.     "

Also, a variety of festivals like Lohri, Holi, Ganesh Chaturthi, Janmashtami, Dussehra, Diwali etc. are celebrated in the hostels, along with flag hoisting on Republic Day and Independence Day, keeping the atmosphere in the hostels vibrant and full of life all year round. Do participate in whatever interests you, of course after having devoted enough time to academics. It helps in breaking the ice and socializing with your batchmates and seniors.     "
1368,"Hostel Council  The hostel council is divided into Cultural (Cult), Maintenance (Maint), Mess and Sports. Each of these councils is headed by Hostel Councillors (or Cos - generally third year students or thirdies) with Hostel Secretaries (Secys - second year students or sophies) assisting them in the administration of the hostels. All cultural programs and activities are the responsibility of the Cult Council; likewise all sports events are managed by the Sports Council. The Mess Council looks after mess and canteen while the Maint Council ensures proper working of the common areas and the hostel maintenance. All the councils are supervised by the Hostel General Secretary (GSec - a fourthie or fifthie = big daddies). To oversee hostel funds and the Student Council, every hostel has a Hall Manager and a Warden and to assist them, there are Warden Nominees. Every hostel also has an Alumni Secretary to maintain cordial relations with the hostel alumni. Computer Secretary (Comp Secy) takes care of the Computer Room and Internet connection problems while Technical Secretary (Tech Secy) manages the Technical Events at hostel and institute level. More details on the specific functions of each council member would be conveyed to you once you reach here     "
1369,"Hostel Spirit and Wing Culture  This is perhaps the best part of the whole deal. With time, all inmates become the part of one big family. For nothing else but the sense of belonging, you are expected to support and cheer for your hostel and other inmates in inter hostel events (this includes hooting for your hostel during the freshman orientation programmes for various clubs, of which you will come to know in due time :P). Blocks of some 10-15 rooms constitute a wing in each hostel and your wingmates (wingies) will be your immediate support group in more ways than one. We cherish the time we have spent with our wingies and we hope you do so too. Your wingies might be people from very diverse backgrounds but do not let that hinder interaction in any way. In fact, use it to your advantage. You would go with your wingies on intra hostel volley and cricket matches, treats (birthdays, crack acads, mentor's placement et al), treks, tours, hang- outs etc all the time. At the same time, socialize with other hostelers - batchmates and seniors alike - all the time. Also, ragging, simply, is a strict no no! Strict actions (expulsion from IITB) are taken against those found guilty "

1372,",  **“There’s life without the Internet? Really? Send me the link.”**      The Internet is one of the first things you want to get sorted out once you are on campus, be it to upload your stories on Snapchat, Facebook and Instagram, or to get your lecture notes and books, and get down to studying. So how and where can I access the Internet? Hostel LAN Access The most preferred option. All hostel rooms have a LAN Port which you can use to connect to the IIT Bombay network and to the Internet, provided you have a computer. Just hook your computer up to the LAN port with a cable, and you should be connected to the network. Once that’s done, there are two ways to access the Internet.     "
1373,"Proxyless Access(recommended)  Go to <https://internet.iitb.ac.in>, log in your LDAP ID(roll number) and password, and you're good to go.

1374,"OSL (Old Software Lab)  The CS101 course labs will be held here. Apart from the few hours per week that you get as part of your lab timings, this lab is not accessible. It also closes after the last running lab course and is not accessible 24x7. Your lab timings would be just enough for you to finish your lab assignments. You will rarely have time to do anything apart from your CS assignment in the OSL.     "
1375,"Department Software Labs  Depending on which department you're in, you may have access to a mediocre to excellent computer lab facility. The NSL (New Software Lab) is the department lab of the Department of CSE. It is accessible 24X7 and is WiFi enabled. The Department of Mechanical Engineering also has a Software Lab that is accessible to all its students any time of the day or night. The Department labs are very good places to study as they are air-conditioned and quiet. Depending on your department, you may or may not have a WiFi network accessible to students. Some departments either have too few computers or irregular lab timings. So this option may not work for you if you happen to be among the unlucky ones. This option also has the disadvantage of being far away from campus     "
1376,"Library  The entire library complex is WiFi enabled. There are also a few PCs distributed across the library. These are, however, intended to be used to look for books and you should refrain from using them for other purposes.     "
1377,"WiFi Access  The Library, and the classrooms in the Lecture Hall Complex(LHs, LCs and LTs) are wifi enabled. Just turn on your WiFi and connect to IITB-Wireless or eduroam with your LDAP ID and password. Your device may also have an anonymous identity field while connecting, which can be left blank.

If you intend to change your branch/specialization after the 1st year, your FacAd is the right person to approach. You may also have to seek the FacAd's permission to participate in inter-collegiate competitions. FacAd is an important link between you and your department.

1379,"Medical  Worried about what to do if you get sick while you’re in IIT-B? You don’t need to at all. The great thing about IIT-B is that it has a hospital inside the campus which will take care of almost all common medical problems you might face. To understand more about how the healthcare works at IIT, click here:     "
1380,"**How do I enroll for medical facilities?**   You are eligible for medical facilities as soon as you are admitted to IIT-B. As you get admitted, you are required to fill in your medical details in a booklet and get yourself vaccinated against certain diseases (I’ll mention about these later). The IIT-B hospital (or “hospi” as we call it here) maintains a medical file for each student to document all of their consultations, prescriptions and medical history. Every time you visit the hospital, you will need this file. In case you choose to keep it with you at your room (which is alright too) don't forget to bring it along.     "
1381,"**What to do if I fall sick or have a medical emergency?**   There is a 24/7 ambulance facility available for all students. For calling an ambulance you can call 1110 from any internal phone. One is placed at the security guard’s desk in every hostel. If you are not in an emergency, you will be required to visit a GP based on a token system or through appointments. Based on their medical evaluation you will be recommended to a specialist if need be.     "
1382,"**How expensive is the treatment?**   All of the medical facilities including prescription medicines are free for IIT students, covered by the annual insurance that you pay with the fees in the odd (Autumn) semester. This insurance also covers you for an amount of close to Rs 50,000 in medical expenses in case you need to be referred to an outside hospital. Even the cost of medicines purchased from a chemist and charges for lab tests can be reimbursed when prescribed by a doctor from the IIT hospital (or from a hospital recognised by IIT - the list of which can be found at <http://www.iitb.ac.in/hospital/index.php>)     "
1383,**What facilities are available at the hospital?**    1. OPD in the hospital that runs from 8 am to 6 pm on weekdays and till 1 pm on weekends    2. The Emergency Ward handles medical cases outside these hours.    3. Pathology and X-Ray facilities    4. There is also a facility for Physiotherapy to deal with fractures and other such ailments.  
1384,"If an MRI or CT scan is required, the IIT hospital refers you to the nearby Hiranandani Hospital (HN) which is less than a kilometer away. Specialist doctors from HN hospital visit the IIT hospital on an appointment basis. For cases that the IIT hospital is not equipped cannot handle, patients are transferred to the HN hospital.     "
1385,"**What if I lose classes or exams because I am sick?**   If you fall sick and are advised to rest by the doctor and hence cannot attend lectures or write examinations, the doctor will give you a ""pink slip"". This slip is the only trusted proof that you were sick and advised rest. In case you missed an end semester exam, you will be given an II grade. This means that you are eligible for a re-examination. Presenting the pink slip to your professor will let him allow you to take the exam again. This system is unremittingly strict and a recommendation from any other doctor or hospital will simply not do.     "
1386,**What vaccinations do I need?**   There are 4 vaccines which you need to be administered with during your stay here. These are :    1. MMR   2. Typhoid   3. Hepatitis A   4. Chicken Pox 
1387,"You can either get them administered from your local doctor in your hometown. In this case you need to show a certificate of vaccination of the same when you fill the medical booklet. If you were unable to get the vaccines, the IITB Hospital arranges a vaccination camp once every month in the Autumn ( Odd ) semester (July - November) where you can get yourself vaccinated. These vaccine costs are not covered in your medical treatment costs. Important Links:     "

1394,"Some labels commonly used by people to describe themselves are lesbian, gay, bisexual, asexual, transgender, intersex, and queer.

They may also face discrimination and bullying on revealing their preferences. At IIT Bombay, however, no student needs to feel alone.     "

1400,"As the hostels are within the campus, your entire life will be usually contained in the campus itself with the occasional outings in search of good food or for treats. Consequently, the campus is well fitted to address all of your needs, be it your daily necessities or your health. We also have a couple of guesthouses which you can avail of (probably) in case you have someone coming over to visit.     "

1403,[ Throughout your course here in IITB you might need various stuff from everyday items like toothpaste and soap to books for subjects. Oftentimes you would also want to detach yourself from your hectic schedule and go visit a restaurant or watch a movie. It is therefore a good idea to familiarize yourself with the various shops and places within the campus and outside it.     
1404,"Stationery and Xerox  Every Hostel has a xerox shop which is normally well equipped to handle basic stationery needs. If you don’t find something in your own hostel, you should most probably find it in the neighbouring hostel. Hostel 12 shop is the best stocked, in that regard. Most hostel xerox shops start at around 10 am and close by 9 pm. Hostel 5 shop is open till a little later (10 pm). If you are closer to the academic area, you can visit the shop in the Main Building on the ground floor, right opposite the library for notebooks, lab coats, bags, lab files, xerox, print out, and most other stationery items. During midsems and endsems, xerox shop timings for some hostels are extended.     "
1405,"Books  For buying books, we have a shop called Book World on campus on the ground floor of the Gulmohar Building where you can get discounts on course-related books. Alternatively, you could go to “Popular Book Store” at YP Gate. You can also buy second-hand books from the Jay Ambe bookshop in the lane right opposite Main Gate, next to Mahavir. He also accepts books back at the end of the semester at half the price at which they were bought.     "
1406,"Daily needs  For the most basic of amenities such as toothpaste, toothbrush, pens, soaps, and other such items (which one should use daily), one can go to the hostel Xerox shop itself. Another alternative would be the Hostel 12/18 shops which stock almost everything one would need and more- from slippers to stationery to biscuits and towels. One can also go to Haiko or D-Mart in the Hiranandani Complex for these. Alternatively, the shopping complex at the Y-Point Gate can also take care of most of your needs. The YP market has a post office, a dry cleaner and a tailor and a barber as well, just in case.     "
1407,"Banks and ATMs  Two major banks operate inside IITB: Canara Bank and SBI. The Canara bank branch is located on the first floor of the Gulmohar building. There are two Canara bank ATMs inside the campus. One is located on the ground floor of the Gulmohar building, while the other is located opposite hostel 7. There are two SBI ATMs as well. One is located between Hostel 5 and Tansa, while the other is right outside the main gate. On the orientation day, both banks set up temporary stalls in the lecture hall complex to ensure a smooth and hassle- free opening of accounts. Debit cards are provided on the spot as well.     "
1408,"Restaurants and Eateries    1. Hostel Canteens: Every hostel has its own canteen, which is for most people, the go-to place for inexpensive food.

Eateries within the institute:      1. Gulmohar Restaurant and Café: Tasty food, reasonable prices and right-next-door!      2. Academic area: The KReSIT canteen is popular for a quick samosa-chai.

Cycling: One may say that they are a popular mode of transportation considering the number of cycles parked outside the hostels. However, their frequency of use often decays exponentially. But it is entirely up to you! Cycling is a quick, eco-friendly and fun way to get from point to point in the institute. Remember that maintenance of your cycle is crucial, especially in Mumbai’s rainy weather. There are two cycle repair shops on campus, one at the Market Gate and the other next to H5. A sturdy lock is also a good investment.    2. Walking: Alumni often reminisce about the good times they had walking to the lecture halls, amongst good company and pristine greenery. It may not always be possible, but when you have the luxury of time, make the most of it!    3. Auto-rickshaws: Auto-rickshaws are fairly common in the institute and are used for traveling both within and outside the institute. There have been issues of rickshaws refusing to go to destinations outside, though there have been measures taken to curb this.    4. E-Shuttle: With a seating capacity of nearly 10-12 students, E-shuttles are a popular choice for most students as they run the entire distance between the residential and academic area, charging a nominal fee of INR 10 per ride.    5. Taxis: Whether while traveling in a group, or when needing a drop to the airport, Uber and Ola have made traveling in comfort easy and economical.  "

The IIT Bombay Gender Cell (GC) inquires into complaints of sexual harassment through its Internal Complaints Committee (GC-ICC). The GC and GC-ICC strive to work towards an egalitarian environment where men and women are afforded equitable treatment and equality of opportunity conducive to their professional growth. "

1416,"[ Hostel Allocation  Room allotment for first year students are done in following manner :      For Boys - They will be allotted 2 wings of hostel 15 and a wing in hostel 16. On each floor, there are three subsections (also called wings!) - each wing has 6 rooms, each of which will be shared by 2 students.   For Girls - A separate wing of Hostel 15 (Hostel 15 C) is allotted to girls, again on a twin sharing basis.     "
1417,"You get the room right when you reach IIT Bombay (on the day of registrations i.e. July 26, 2019), as well as in the hostel warden’s office.      Basic Amenities  Each room has a pair of beds, tables, chairs, ceiling fans, tube lights, cupboards and are equipped with 24x7 high speed internet connectivity. There are 2 washrooms per 6 rooms with 24x7 running water (both hot and cold). Each Hostel has a mess (dining hall), a computer room, a gym, a TV, sports grounds and indoor games like Table Tennis, Carrom, Chess, the equipment for which can be availed against your ID Card. Also, stationery and xerox shops are present in Hostel 15 and 16 for fulfilling basic requirements.     "
1418,"Hostel/Room Change  The procedure of shifting rooms basically goes through the warden of the hostel through a written application citing the reasons for the change. It will be a great experience to have a new guy as a roommate which will eventually help you in making new friends which you'll cherish for your life. Though, definitely if both of you agree, it will make things easier.     "
1419,"Rules for visitors  Parents are not allowed to stay in the hostels without prior permission from the Hostel Coordinating Unit. Till 10 PM, female visitors to boys hostels and boys wings in Hostel 15 and male visitors to girls hostel and girls wing in Hostel 15 are allowed after entering details in a register kept with the security at the hostel entrance and after depositing the host's I-Card. After 10PM, entry is restricted only to the common areas — Mess, Lounge and Canteen.     "
1420,"Hostel Activities  There are a plethora of activities that go around in the hostel which makes life fun. Lot of intra hostel events and competitions (among your hostel inmates) or practice for inter hostel (with other hostels) competitions in sports and cultural activities take place all year round. Also, a variety of festivals like Lohri, Holi, Ganesh Chaturthi, Janmashtami, Dussehra, Diwali etc. are celebrated in the hostels, along with flag hoisting on Republic Day and Independence Day, keeping the atmosphere in the hostels vibrant and full of life all year round. Do participate in whatever interests you, of course after having devoted enough time to academics. It helps in breaking the ice and socializing with your batchmates and seniors.     "
1421,"Hostel Council  The hostel council is divided into Cultural (Cult), Maintenance (Maint), Mess and Sports. Each of these councils is headed by Hostel Councillors (or Cos - generally third year students or thirdies) with Hostel Secretaries (Secys - second year students or sophies) assisting them in the administration of the hostels. All cultural programs and activities are the responsibility of the Cult Council; likewise all sports events are managed by the Sports Council. The Mess Council looks after mess and canteen while the Maint Council ensures proper working of the common areas and the hostel maintenance. All the councils are supervised by the Hostel General Secretary (GSec - a fourthie or fifthie = big daddies). To oversee hostel funds and the Student Council, every hostel has a Hall Manager and a Warden and to assist them, there are Warden Nominees. Every hostel also has an Alumni Secretary to maintain cordial relations with the hostel alumni. Computer Secretary (Comp Secy) takes care of the Computer Room and Internet connection problems while Technical Secretary (Tech Secy) manages the Technical Events at hostel and institute level. More details on the specific functions of each council member would be conveyed to you once you reach here     "
1422,"Hostel Spirit and Wing Culture  This is the best part of the whole year. With time, all hostel residents become part of one big family. For nothing else but the sense of belonging, you are expected to support and cheer for your hostel and other residents in inter hostel events (this includes hooting for your hostel during the freshman orientation programmes for various clubs, of which you will come to know in due time :P). Blocks of some 10-15 rooms constitute a wing in each hostel and your wingmates (wingies) will be your immediate support group in more ways than one. We cherish the time we have spent with our wingies and we hope you do so too. Your wingies might be people from very diverse backgrounds but do not let that hinder interaction in any way. In fact, use it to your advantage. You would go with your wingies on intra hostel volley and cricket matches, treats (birthdays, crack acads, mentor's placement et al), treks, tours, hang- outs etc all the time. At the same time, socialize with other hostelers - batchmates and seniors alike - all the time. Also, ragging, simply, is a strict no no! Strict actions (expulsion from IITB) are taken against those found guilty. "

1425,",  **“There’s life without the Internet? Really? Send me the link.”**      The Internet is one of the first things you want to get sorted out once you are on campus, be it to upload your stories on Snapchat, Facebook and Instagram, or to get your lecture notes and books, and get down to studying. So how and where can I access the Internet? Hostel LAN Access The most preferred option. All hostel rooms have a LAN Port which you can use to connect to the IIT Bombay network and to the Internet, provided you have a computer. Just hook your computer up to the LAN port with a cable, and you should be connected to the network. Once that’s done, there are two ways to access the Internet.     "
1426,"Proxyless Access(recommended)  Go to <https://internet.iitb.ac.in>, log in your LDAP ID(roll number) and password, and you're good to go.   For more details, please visit <https://www.cc.iitb.ac.in/>      Other Hostel Facilities  You can use the Hostel Computer Room for accessing the Internet. The Hostel Xerox shop owner also sometimes lets you surf the Internet for a small fee. Check with the respective shopkeeper for details.     "
1427,"OSL (Old Software Lab)  The CS101 course labs will be held here. Apart from the few hours per week that you get as part of your lab timings, this lab is not accessible. It also closes after the last running lab course and is not accessible 24x7. Your lab timings would be just enough for you to finish your lab assignments. You will rarely have time to do anything apart from your CS assignment in the OSL.     "
1428,"Department Software Labs  Depending on which department you're in, you may have access to a mediocre to excellent computer lab facility. The NSL (New Software Lab) is the department lab of the Department of CSE. It is accessible 24X7 and is WiFi enabled. The Department of Mechanical Engineering also has a Software Lab that is accessible to all its students any time of the day or night. The Department labs are very good places to study as they are air-conditioned and quiet. Depending on your department, you may or may not have a WiFi network accessible to students. Some departments either have too few computers or irregular lab timings. So this option may not work for you if you happen to be among the unlucky ones. This option also has the disadvantage of being far away from campus     "
1429,"Library  The entire library complex is WiFi enabled. There are also a few PCs distributed across the library. These are, however, intended to be used to look for books and you should refrain from using them for other purposes.     "
1430,"WiFi Access  The Library, and the classrooms in the Lecture Hall Complex(LHs, LCs and LTs) are wifi enabled. Just turn on your WiFi and connect to IITB-Wireless or eduroam with your LDAP ID and password. Your device may also have an anonymous identity field while connecting, which can be left blank. The IITB-Guest WiFi is meant for short term visitors, and will also require LDAP authentication through a separate portal.     "

There are several student bodies that work under the aegis of the Gymkhana. 
1433,",  So you thought it was all about academics? Wrong! IITB is privileged to have one of the best cultural (or 'cult') scenes among engineering colleges in India. Apart from hosting Mood Indigo, India's biggest college cultural festival, we have a very active intra-college scene, with genre specific clubs and plenty of hostel and insti-level events all year round. The scene is basically split into 10 genres: Music, Photography & Fine Arts, Speaking/Debating, Literary Arts, Photography & Fine Arts, Dance, Dramatics, Film & Media, Design and Lifestyle.     "

Working with him are 8 Institute Secretaries, for the aforementioned 10 genres. Each secretary is the head of the club(s) under his/her domain. Also, at the hostel level, each hostel has a Cultural Councilor along with a secretary for each of the genres. The incoming freshers are pre allocated to the hostels they are going into the next year and they represent their senior hostels throughout the year.     "

Recently, even freshies have been allowed to represent their senior year hostels in GCs. In addition, the cultural council organizes a huge number of open events spread across the year. These events have no restrictions; some, on the contrary, have freshmen reservations.     "
1448,"**Inter college events**   Every December, IITB hosts India's biggest cult fest, Mood Indigo. MI is a 4 day long cultural extravaganza that sees participation by thousands of students from all over the country. Apart from formal and informal competitions and workshops, it also organizes concerts and performances by international artistes. IITB students attend numerous college cult fests but we only send official contingents to two, St. Xavier's Malhar (around 15th Aug) in Mumbai and IIM-B's Unmaad (around 29th Jan). Freshies generally attend Unmaad in large numbers.     "
1449,"**Performing Arts Festival (PAF)**   PAF is also known as the 'Baap of all cultural events’. Typically, three or four hostels (out of fourteen) are grouped together to battle against one another. From script to dance, music to dram, every damn thing is handled by the students. PAF is renowned for its 'Prod work' which involves the making of sets and backdrops. A tremendous mixture of art and cultural skills combined with life sized sets, is what makes PAF an event to remember.     "
1450,"By that time, you will be allotted your 'permanent' hostels and hence will be a good time to make new friends and get acquainted with the hostel culture.      At the end of the academic year, the institute hands out awards to those who have excelled in cultural activities, along with the inter-hostel GC and PAF trophies.     "
1451,"So there you have it. Cult at IITB is truly in a league of its own, so please do grab every opportunity to be a part of it. And remember, never be hesitant to join a club or attend a meeting just because you feel you're not good enough - most of us knew nothing about our current cult interests/passions when we first started out, back in our first years. The institute clubs welcome students of all levels, from noobs to pros.     "
1452,"A mandatory word of caution though: do not sacrifice your academics for the sake of extra- curricular activities; prioritize your interests and allocate your time wisely. That being said, we do hope you enjoy every bit of your 4/5 years here, and hopefully the cultural scene would be a major part of your college lives.     "
1453,**InterIIT Cult**   Each and every IIT is different from the other in most of the aspects from the academic valuation to various clubs and their activities.To bridge this gap among all IITs and to enable knowledge sharing and cultural distribution Inter IIT cultural meet was started in 2016 with IIT Bombay organising it for the first time.     
1454,IIT Bombay won the overall championship in 2016 and were 1st runner up in 2017. All the club secretaries and club people look forward to participating and competing in this ultimate cultural championship. It is an honor to get a chance to represent IIT Bombay and selections are based on the various auditions conducted across different genres.     
1455,"The 4th edition of Inter IIT Cultural Meet will be held in December 2019 and it will include competitions covering all the cultural genres.  ,  The Institute has a very active media scene in terms of Newsletters, Magazines, Video coverage and IITB Radio. While Insight, the media body of IIT Bombay, releases newsletters specifically for freshmen, amongst others, several departments and institute bodies also put out their own newsletters. IIT BBC pioneers the video content scene in the campus, and to cater to those who enjoy radio, we also have the IITB radio.     "
1456,"Newsletters and Magazines  Insight is currently the only active media body in the institute run voluntarily by students. Aawaaz was the media body for Hindi but is now dissolved.      Insight  If you like writing, have a flair for journalism and you want to work on high impact pieces that usher changes in the institute or simply want to publish a few leisure pieces for light reading and humour you would like to work with the student media body Insight. Insight publishes online content on their website along with offline newsletters which are delivered door to door.

1459,"Excellence in sports is a direct index of the stature and intellectual maturity of an institute. IIT Bombay has always aimed to set a precedent for other institutions by laying utmost emphasis on the multifaceted development of its students and pushing them to raise the bar by striving to be ‘Citius, Altius, Fortius’. With a deeply ingrained sports culture and the ‘Right of Sports for all’ as a cornerstone of its Sports policy, the institute has, over the years, channelized its resources towards the development of a state of the art sporting complex that caters to over fourteen sports. All the facilities are helmed by seasoned training staff so that even beginners have a beautiful chance to learn the craft and their more experienced counterparts can receive the requisite guidance.

"
1461,"Sports for everyone  A passion for sports has always been a part of the very fabric of the institute. To ensure a healthy continuity of this tradition the Sports Council organises a multitude of sports and fitness camps that vary in the degree of professionalism (amateur, intermediate or advanced) as well as the rigour of instruction.     "
1462,"Moreover, to keep with dynamically evolving exercise regimens, workshops on modern forms like Zumba, Mixed Martial Arts and AquaYoga and target specific weight loss camps are conducted. And to satisfy the cravings of the adventure streak in all of us, there are regular excursions to the Himalayas, daunting treks and adrenaline pumping sports like rafting, rock climbing and mountaineering, with scuba diving plans in the pipeline.

1540,"Sports for everyone  A passion for sports has always been a part of the very fabric of the institute. To ensure a healthy continuity of this tradition the Sports Council organises a multitude of sports and fitness camps that vary in the degree of professionalism (amateur, intermediate or advanced) as well as the rigour of instruction.     "
1541,"Moreover, to keep with dynamically evolving exercise regimens, workshops on modern forms like Zumba, Mixed Martial Arts and AquaYoga and target specific weight loss camps are conducted. And to satisfy the cravings of the adventure streak in all of us, there are regular excursions to the Himalayas, daunting treks and adrenaline pumping sports like rafting, rock climbing and mountaineering, with scuba diving plans in the pipeline.     "
1542,"The Government of India, through the National Sports Organisation, mandates that all incoming freshmen must undergo a structured training in a sport of their choice. At IIT Bombay, NSO forms an integral part of the curriculum and classes are offered in sports with biweekly instruction.     "
1543,"Aavhan  Aavhan is a three day extravaganza that brought together participants to combine the thrill of competition with the joy of sports. The state-of- the- art facilities at the institute played host to over three thousand sportspersons representing universities, clubs and organizations across the nation. Tough battles were waged across courts, fields and the pool in a bid to bring home the glittering trophies that were at stake in thirteen different sports.     "
1544,"The inaugural edition of Aavhan, IIT Bombay’s sports festival, which was held from 24 th May 2017 to 26 th May 2017,The fever that had engulfed the campus was tangible as all events witnessed large spectator turnout. Despite there being some of the finest talent from across the country for display, the IIT Bombay contingent refused to give any quarter and ensured that all their opponents had to toil and prove their mettle to emerge champions.     "
1545,"The extensive planning and relentless work that was put in by the Sports Council, the support staff and other authorities to get the sponsors on board and translate this long standing dream into a reality was evident from the flawless execution of the event. The grand success of the festival can be attributed to the way it managed to capture the passion to conquer and the quest for glory- the very essence of all sporting activity. Now that Aavhan is set to be an annual fixture, it only promises to get bigger, better and more entertaining and we couldn’t be more excited!     "
1546,"The Council  The responsibility for the efficient management of all issues pertaining to sports at the institute level rests with the Sports Council, an annually elected body. Helmed by the General Secretary, the council comprises 4 nominees, 14 sport-specific secretaries, 1 Technical Head, 1 Creatives Head and a Conveners.     "
1547,"Championships  At the institute level itself, a steady string of competitive events is organised throughout the year with tournaments on conventional sports, upcoming games as well as their modern improvisations. The General Championships are keenly contested as they bring budding talent into the spotlight besides resting on a traditional yet healthy inter-hostel rivalry as its bedrock. The ever increasing participation among girls has prompted the advent of a separate Girls GC which is now a permanent fixture. Outside of the mainstream GC framework, leagues and events are also organised periodically to allow players to hone and display their skills and to instil a sporting ethic among all students. For fostering a spirit of fraternity in the hostels, the Hostel Council holds multiple events to promote interaction across batches and departments.     "

1549,"Moreover, considering the level at which the competition operates and the fact that it is the highest stature that can be associated with a sportsperson at the institute, getting to represent IITB at this event in the first year itself ought to be a matter of great honour and pride for any freshman.     "
1550,"In recent years, IITB won the Overall General Championships for 3 consecutive years 2007- 2009, and then again in 2012. The 50 th Inter IIT Sport Meet was hosted rather magnificently by the institute. That there have been several instances of individuals being crowned champions at the meet in sports they learnt only after joining the institute speaks volumes of how IIT Bombay provides ample opportunities to cultivate talent and nurture it.     "
1551,"The championship is held in December every year, with a separate aquatics meet in October. For the main meet, selection trials commence in October. Those selected become a part of the Inter IIT Training Camp which begins from 1 st December, continuing until the date of departure.     "

Recently, even freshies have been allowed to represent their senior year hostels in GCs. In addition, the cultural council organizes a huge number of open events spread across the year. These events have no restrictions; some, on the contrary, have freshmen reservations.     "
1568,"**Inter college events**   Every December, IITB hosts India's biggest cult fest, Mood Indigo. MI is a 4 day long cultural extravaganza that sees participation by thousands of students from all over the country. Apart from formal and informal competitions and workshops, it also organizes concerts and performances by international artistes. IITB students attend numerous college cult fests but we only send official contingents to two, St. Xavier's Malhar (around 15th Aug) in Mumbai and IIM-B's Unmaad (around 29th Jan). Freshies generally attend Unmaad in large numbers.     "
1569,"**Performing Arts Festival (PAF)**   PAF is also known as the 'Baap of all cultural events’. Typically, three or four hostels (out of fourteen) are grouped together to battle against one another. From script to dance, music to dram, every damn thing is handled by the students. PAF is renowned for its 'Prod work' which involves the making of sets and backdrops. A tremendous mixture of art and cultural skills combined with life sized sets, is what makes PAF an event to remember.     "
1570,"By that time, you will be allotted your 'permanent' hostels and hence will be a good time to make new friends and get acquainted with the hostel culture.      At the end of the academic year, the institute hands out awards to those who have excelled in cultural activities, along with the inter-hostel GC and PAF trophies.     "
1571,"So there you have it. Cult at IITB is truly in a league of its own, so please do grab every opportunity to be a part of it. And remember, never be hesitant to join a club or attend a meeting just because you feel you're not good enough - most of us knew nothing about our current cult interests/passions when we first started out, back in our first years. The institute clubs welcome students of all levels, from noobs to pros.     "
1572,"A mandatory word of caution though: do not sacrifice your academics for the sake of extra- curricular activities; prioritize your interests and allocate your time wisely. That being said, we do hope you enjoy every bit of your 4/5 years here, and hopefully the cultural scene would be a major part of your college lives.     "
1573,**InterIIT Cult**   Each and every IIT is different from the other in most of the aspects from the academic valuation to various clubs and their activities.To bridge this gap among all IITs and to enable knowledge sharing and cultural distribution Inter IIT cultural meet was started in 2016 with IIT Bombay organising it for the first time.     
1574,IIT Bombay won the overall championship in 2016 and were 1st runner up in 2017.

1674,"[ Dear Parent/Guardian,      Congratulations! The Institute Student Mentorship Program (ISMP) would like to welcome you and your ward to one of the most prestigious institutes in the country, the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB). As you may know, this institute is the alma-mater to some of the most distinguished personalities, globally. The institute aims, and strives to produce citizens who shall serve for the betterment of the society, country and above all, mankind.     "
1675,"We believe that, as well-informed parents, you should become familiar with both the academic and extra-curricular lifestyle of the students on this campus, and get an idea about the opportunities that your ward will have here, as well as the underlying responsibilities that would be expected of him/her.     "
1676,"Institute Student Mentor Programme (ISMP)  In the Institute, we have a group of credible senior students motivated to help guide the first year students with respect to all aspects of college life. The Institute Student Mentor Programme, aims at providing guidance and help to all the first-year students. The mentors help the new entrants make a smooth transition from their life at home to life on campus. It would be advisable for you to talk to the mentors on the day of the orientation. Moreover, it would be beneficial if you could also stay in touch with mentors during the course of the semester.     "
1677,"Academic Structure  A typical academic year at IIT Bombay is divided into two semesters – Autumn Semester (July-November) and Spring Semester (January-May). The curriculum at IIT Bombay is based on the credit system. Each course is allotted credits based on the number of lectures, tutorials and lab hours per week.     "
1678,"There is a continuous evaluation by means of quizzes, assignments, mid- semester, end-semester examinations and lab work throughout the semester. At the end of each semester, the student gets an SPI (Semester Performance Index) which is an average of the grades in each of the courses he/she had registered for in that semester, weighted with the credits of those courses respectively. CPI (Cumulative Performance Index) is a weighted average of all the SPIs (till date) weighted on the number of total credits each semester.     "
1679,"It is advised that students do not miss classes due to trips home or otherwise. Also, it is important for all students to attend classes during the first week of each semester, except for genuine medical reasons. When medical problems arise, the student is advised to inform the mentor and the professors concerned if he/she is missing classes. Professors might require medical certificates issued or authenticated by the IITB Hospital or other supporting documents in such cases.     "
1680,"Students who enter this institute every year are some of the best students in the country. Due to the competitive environment here, we have often seen students, who have until now always topped their class, find it difficult to obtain grades that meet their expectations. This has often led to students experiencing excessive pressure or students adopting an indifferent attitude which further reduces their academic performance. We hope that you would encourage your ward to put his/ her best foot forward - put in the best effort from his/her side.     "
1681,"Hostel Life  At this institute, we believe in the overall development of our students. The general lifestyle of students includes a lot of extracurricular activities in the fields of sports, cultural and technical activities, at intra-hostel, inter-hostel and inter-college events. The environment here is very conducive to growth and our institute has some of the best facilities across all other colleges/institutes in India. So, we encourage students to take up whatever interests them, and we request you to support them in their choices. There is enough time in a normal IIT student’s day to fit in both academics and extracurricular activities without much stress. But, at the same time, it is advised that care must be taken to ensure proper time management such that academics are not neglected because of such activities.     "
1682,Hostels are an integral part of every IIT students’ life. The hostels are well equipped with the necessary infrastructure and mess facilities. First-year students stay in double-sharing hostel rooms with their batchmates.     
1683,"The transition of your ward, from your loving and caring hands to a completely new and competitive environment of IIT, could occasionally cause adjustment problems in the initial period of their stay. Many students find it difficult getting used to a roommate and hostel life for the first time. Sometimes, cultural, social and language differences further delay the settling in process. As mentors, we help the freshmen have a smooth transition so that this settling-in process is as short as possible and your ward feels comfortable in this new setting quickly.     "
1684,"Financial Help  In case you are worried about the financial expenses, please note that help is available. Merit-Cum-Means Scholarship, Facility for Free Messing, Named Scholarships and Remission of Fee are some of the ways through which the students in need can be provided with financial help. The details are available at the following link: http://www.iitb.ac.in/newacadhome/scholar.jsp   Information related to scholarships is available here.     "
1685,"Language Help  English is used for all official purposes and is the medium of instruction during classes. We understand that learning to speak and grasping english might prove to be a challenge for some students. We try to fulfil this need via our British Council program where trained professionals come and teach students the language from its very basics. Apart from that, students enthusiastic to learn english, can also benefit from student-run ELIT Classes which can help your wards improve their English language.     "
1686,"Some important issues  Ragging in any form is strictly banned in the campus. The student should report any such untoward incident to his/her mentor immediately. We assure you that it will be dealt with confidentiality and with the highest priority. We believe that you will be reassured by the steps that have been taken by the Institute to prevent ragging. Interaction of the freshmen with seniors (other than the appointed mentors) is also regulated during their initial stay, so they get time to adjust. Strict penalties are very much in place, and mentors are always available to resolve any situations promptly. Rest assured, ragging has vanished from the IIT-Bombay campus.     "
1687,"However, it is expected that the freshmen also develop a healthy rapport with their seniors who are amongst the brightest in the country and excel in various activities. In fact, a healthy senior junior interaction has been the hallmark of this institute and we would like to maintain it in that way.     "
1688,"It is important to note, IIT Bombay considers the health of its students to be of ultimate importance. Considering the current pandemic, IIT Bombay is trying to make sure the onboarding is done smoothly.   IIT Bombay is committed to provide appropriate support to all students in need. We also want to assure you that students will be called to the institute by the administration only when the institute is deemed safe to return.     "
1689,"We hope that this gives you a fair idea about the life here on campus. This institute offers a wide range of opportunities and we hope that your ward shall have a productive and memorable time in the institute. In case you have any doubts or need to know more about any aspect of the life of a student at IITB, feel free to reach out to us using the information provided on the official Student Mentorship Program (SMP) website or via our official facebook page and we will be happy to answer all your questions.

1692,इंस्टीट्यूट छात्र मंथन कार्यक्रम (आईएसएमपी )  इस संस्थान में सभी प्रथम वर्ष के छात्रों के परामर्शदाता (मेंटर) के रूप में सम्मानीय और वरिष्ठ चौथे / पाँचवे वर्ष में पढ़ रहे छात्र हैं। इन सलाहकारों ने एक साथ छात्र परामर्शदाता (मेंटर) कार्यक्रम का गठन किया है जिसका उद्देश्य प्रथम वर्ष के छात्रों को मार्गदर्शन और सहायता प्रदान करना है। यह मेंटर पहले साल के छात्रों का घर से कॉलेज के एक कष्टरहित संक्रमण बनाने में और अपने रास्ते में बाधाओं को दूर करने में मदद करते हैं। जब आप अपने वार्ड के साथ अभिविन्यास के लिए कॉलेज परिसर आयेंगे हैं तो आपका मेंटर्स से मिलना उचित रहेगा। यदि आप सेमेस्टर के दौरान मेंटर्स के साथ संपर्क में रहें तो यह फायदेमंद रहेगा।     
1693,"शैक्षणिक संरचना   आईआईटी बॉम्बे में एक शैक्षणिक वर्ष दो सेमेस्टर में विभाजित है - शरद ऋतु सेमेस्टर (जुलाई-नवंबर) और वसंत सेमेस्टर (जनवरी-अप्रैल)। आईआईटी मुंबई में पाठ्यक्रम क्रेडिट प्रणाली पर आधारित है। हर कोर्स में प्रति सप्ताह व्याख्यान, ट्यूटोरियल और प्रयोगशाला घंटे की संख्या के आधार पर क्रेडिट आवंटित किया जाता है।   क्विज़, असाइनमेंट, मिड सेमेस्टर, एंड-सेमेस्टर परीक्षाओं और प्रयोगशाला सेमेस्टर के माध्यम से छात्रों का निरंतर मूल्यांकन किया जाता है। प्रत्येक सेमेस्टर के अंत में, छात्र एक एसपीआई (सेमेस्टर परफॉर्मेंस इंडेक्स) प्राप्त करता है, जो उस सेमेस्टर पाठ्यक्रमों के क्रेडिट के साथ क्रमशः प्रत्येक पाठ्यक्रम में ग्रेड की औसत है। सीपीआई (संचयी प्रदर्शन सूचकांक) सभी एसपीआई के एक भारित औसत (आज तक) कुल क्रेडिट की संख्या पर प्रत्येक सेमेस्टर भारित है।     "
1694,"कक्षाओं में एक स्थिर उपस्थिति बनाए रखने के महत्व को कम नहीं आँका जा सकता है। यह सलाह दी जाती है कि छात्र घर की यात्राएं या अन्यथा के कारण कक्षाएं ना छोड़े। इसके अलावा, सभी छात्रों के लिए प्रत्येक सेमेस्टर के पहले सप्ताह के दौरान कक्षाओं में उपस्थित होना अनिवार्य है, समुचित चिकित्सा कारणों को छोड़कर। अगर चिकित्सकीय समस्याएं पैदा होती हैं, तो छात्र को सलाह दी जाती है कि वह मेंटर और प्रोफेसरों को सूचित करे कि क्या वह कक्षाएं में अनुपस्थित रह रहा है। प्रोफेसरों को ऐसे मामलों में आईआईटीबी अस्पताल या अन्य सहायक दस्तावेजों द्वारा जारी या प्रमाणित मेडिकल प्रमाण पत्रों की आवश्यकता हो सकती है।   हर साल इस संस्थान में प्रवेश करने वाले छात्र देश के कुछ बेहतरीन दिमाग वाले होते है । यहां प्रतिस्पर्धी माहौल के कारण, हम अक्सर ऐसे मामलों का अनुभव करते हैं, जहां छात्रों ने हमेशा विद्यालय में अपनी कक्षा में प्रथम स्थान प्राप्त किया था, और यहाँ उन्हें अपनी उम्मीदों से अनुसार ग्रेड प्राप्त करना मुश्किल हो गया। यह अक्सर दो चरम सीमाओं में से एक की तरफ चले जाता है: कुछ छात्र अत्यधिक माता-पिता के दबाव का सामना करते हैं, जबकि अन्य केवल एक उदासीन रवैया अपनाते हैं जो आगे उनके शैक्षणिक प्रदर्शन को कम करता है। हम आशा करते हैं कि आप अपने वार्ड को अपने सर्वश्रेष्ठ कदम को आगे बढ़ाने के लिए प्रोत्साहित करेंगे - परिणामों के बजाय, उद्देश्य के रूप में अपनी ओर से सर्वोत्तम प्रयास का इलाज करें।     "
1695,"छात्रावास जीवन  इस संस्थान में हम अपने छात्रों के समग्र विकास में विश्वास करते हैं। विद्यार्थियों की सामान्य जीवन शैली में खेल-कूद, सांस्कृतिक और तकनीकी गतिविधियों के क्षेत्रों में इंट्रा हॉस्टल, इंटर होस्टेल और इंटर कॉलेज कार्यक्रमों में बहुत से गतिविधियों को शामिल किया गया है। पर्यावरण विकास के लिए बहुत अनुकूल है और हमारे संस्थान में देश भर में कुछ बेहतरीन सुविधाएं हैं। इसलिए, हम विद्यार्थियों को उन हितों को उठाने के लिए प्रोत्साहित करते हैं जो उन्हें पसंद हैं और आपसे अनुरोध करते हैं कि आप उनके विकल्पों में सहायता करें। एक सामान्य आईआईटी छात्र के जीवनशैली में एक दिन में पर्याप्त शिक्षा के साथ साथ पाठ्येतर गतिविधियों के लिए पर्याप्त समय होता है। लेकिन, साथ में यह सलाह भी दी जाती है कि उचित समय प्रबंधन सुनिश्चित करने के लिए देखभाल की जानी चाहिए ताकि ऐसी गतिविधियों के कारण शैक्षणिक कामों की उपेक्षा न हो।     "

If a student with CPI x is shifted from branch A to branch B then every student with CPI x with a request for branch B will be shifted to branch B, even if their request violates (ii) above. If necessary, extra seats will be created to accommodate them. Shifts as above are performed as long as there are valid requests. Note that even though a student may have been allotted a seat of lower preference earlier due to unavailability of a seat of higher preference, his/her request for the higher preference seat may become valid later because of availability of seats.    4. All branch transfers can be effected only once at the beginning of the second academic year. No application for change of branch during the subsequent academic years will be entertained.    5.

To prevent misuse of WiFi networks on IITB campus, all residents using WiFi are hereby advised to implement the following guidelines on their WiFi access points with immediate effect. "
1751,**1\. Change the default Login ID and Password**  Change the default Login ID and password used to access the AP console. Use a strong password that is at least eight characters long and is a mix of alphanumeric and special characters. This will prevent unauthorized users from logging into your WiFi router and manipulating its settings. 
1752,"**2\. Change the default SSID**  (service set identifier)SSID is a name given to your WiFi AP to let WiFi clients identify it and connect to it. Change the vendor­default SSID. Pick a name that is simple to remember but does not reveal your identity or any other private information. “Prof. Phanse” or “Hostel 1 Room 20” would be examples of a poorly chosen SSID. Use strong encryption and authentication Use WiFi Protected Access (WPA) or WPA2 with Pre-Shared Key (PSK) authentication. Prefer the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption. If AES is not supported on your AP or laptop, you can choose Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) encryption. "

Use a strong passphrase (also known as WPA Shared Key) that is at least eight characters long and is a mix of alphanumeric and special characters. "
1754,**3\. Restrict remote access to your WiFi AP Disable remote administration:**  To ensure that no one can change the settings on your wireless router from the Internet.Disable administration via wireless: This ensures that the AP’ s console is accessible only if you are connected to it via an Ethernet cable.Use HTTPS: for logging into your AP’s console.

1780,Yes No  #### LDAP Login policy     #####  LDAP Account Expiry Policy  ![](/assets/icons/Plus.svg)  **LDAP Account Expiry Policy**  Version 2010/12/30     **LDAP Account Expiry Policy for different USER categories At IIT Bombay**  **Background:**  You are probably here because you have received a machine generated mail about account expiry and have followed the link mentioned in that mail. Let us begin with a brief outline of how the automatic warning system works. All accounts in the LDAP system have an account expiry date. This is set at the time of your account creation as per your expected tenure at IITB. There are various auotmated procedures for extending your tenure by way of updating the expiry date (please see below) and can even be updated manually by submitting some valid DOCUMENT for ACCOUNT EXTENSION at CC office. 
1781,"As the expiry date nears, automated mails are sent out every Monday morning alerting the user about the approaching expiry event. Roughly 4-5 such warnings are sent out (some users get irritated by such warnings but a majority of them want us to remind them) in order to inform the users and enable them to take action so as to get their tenure extended if needed. After these warnings the account (if not extended) continues to function for some time (i.e. the account enters a GRACE PERIOD) so that users can transfer their mails, and take backup of their files, etc. "
1782,"Important Note:  The expiry date of the accounts can be extended during the GRACE PERIOD too.  After the GRACE PERIOD is over, the LDAP accounts will be frozen without any further warning (again, this is as per the feedback received from the users). "
1783,"If and when the account gets frozen, the mailbox contents and the filestore contents may get removed as the area may get allocated to the new users.  **The Details:**  1\. Upon completion of one's tenure at IITB (due to completion of degree, resignation/retirement or when they finally leave the institute,if on extension after retirement), normal LDAP services will continue to be available during SHIFTOVER (or GRACE) PERIOD (duration of this is dependent on user category; please refer to the table below). It is desirable that all users should, a few months before their above LDAP services are terminated, add a permanent, non-iitb email id to their signature in order to publicize the new email id and minimize loss of incoming emails. When leaving the institute (or latest at the end of SHIFTOVER PERIOD, users must ensure that they setup a FORWARDING ADDRESS (by visiting the URL <https://camp.iitb.ac.in> ) so that all mails addressed to their LDAP account gets redirected to the new address. "
1784,"User Category| Grace Period| Services During Grace Period| Services After Grace Period   ---|---|---|---      User Category  |  Grace Period  |  Services During Grace Period  |  Services After Grace Period      ---|---|---|---   UG and PG student | Three months after the EXPIRY date in LDAP record | Full Email Services (Including mailing lists membership),BIGHOME FILE STORAGE, HOMEPAGES, NEWSGROUP ACCESS | Email in FORWARDINGONLY mode (i.e. No login permitted, NEWSGROUP access via http://varta.iitb.ac.in   Research Scholars | One year after the EXPIRY date in LDAP record | Full Email Services (Including mailing lists membership),BIGHOME FILE STORAGE, HOMEPAGES, NEWSGROUP ACCESS | Email in FORWARDINGONLY mode (i.e. No login permitted, NEWSGROUP access via http://varta.iitb.ac.in   Faculty Members and Permanent Staff | One year after the EXPIRY date in LDAP record | Full Email Services (Including mailing lists membership),BIGHOME FILE STORAGE, HOMEPAGES, NEWSGROUP ACCESS | Email in FORWARDINGONLY mode (i.e. No login permitted, NEWSGROUP access via http://varta.iitb.ac.in   Temporary Staff (both institute and project category) | Three months after the EXPIRY date in LDAP record | Full Email Services (Including mailing lists membership),BIGHOME FILE STORAGE, HOMEPAGES, NEWSGROUP ACCESS | Email in FORWARDINGONLY mode (i.e. No login permitted, NEWSGROUP access via http://varta.iitb.ac.in     "
1785,   2\. The following important points may please be noted:  The FORWARDING ADDRESS will have to be setup by the users themselves. Pl donot ask CC staff to change it on your behalf. 
1786,"After the LDAP id is marked ""FORWARDINGONLY"" CC has no responsibility about the MAILBOX contents. Access to such mailboxes may be permitted on a ""as-is"" basis against payment of a fee (currently Rs 1000/-). "
1787,"After the GRACE PERIOD, LDAP records of the users will be examined and all LDAP ids who donot have FORWARDING ADDRESS will be terminated (hence the ids will be free for use by new users) with immediate effect. "
1788,"After the GRACE PERIOD is over, the account will be marked as FORWARDINGONLY and thereafter no login is possible on the webmail server and the BIGHOME server. Only NEWSGROUP access is permissible. The NEWSGROUP ACCESS profile of all such users will be monitored. All ids that show continuous no-access period of three months or more will be marked as “INACTIVE” and will be phased out. To avoid being treated as inactive, the FORWARDINGONLY account holders must ensure that they do not have inactivity periods of more than three months. "
1789,"3\. In case you feel that the expiry date of your in LDAP record is not set correctly, please take appropriate action to get your account revalidated as soon as possible (the possible procedures for updating the expiry dates are given below). If you have any further queries please come down to CC HELPDESK. CC website (https://www.cc.iitb.ac.in) has the details about the venue and the timing of HELPDESK sessions. PLEASE DO NOT DISTURB ANY CC STAFF OUTSIDE THE HELPDESK HOURS FOR THE PURPOSE OF UPDATING EXPIRY DATES. "
1790,Project staff may please get their status updated in the IRCC database as we strictly follow that as the authentic source. Your status and tenure details will be fetched from IRCC and your LDAP record will be automatically updated accordingly. 
1791,"For faculty members or institute staff (both temporary and permanent category), we are totally dependent on ASC to update the expiry dates in the computerized database maintained by them. The details will be fetched from there and your status will be automatically updated accordingly. Hence your are advised to contact ASC and get your tenure updated there. "
1792,"In a few cases where the relevant database entries in IRCC or ASC are not updated but the user has a supporting document (such as appointment letter, or Identity card etc), the user may approach Computer Centre along with a photocopy of the document. The document must clearly show your present status and period over which it is valid. Please drop the photocopy of your EXTENSION DOCUMENTS in the drop box located in CC office. "
1793,"4\. If you are really about to leave IITB please do pay attention to the following:  Register a forwarding address to a non-IITB email account so that your future emails get redirected to your new address. However, mails already accumulated in your mailbox will not be automagically moved to your new address. They have to be explicitly fetched via POP/IMAP to your new email account. This has to be done while account is still in **active** state. Once your account is inactive, the accumulated mails may not be available. Just like emails, the files in your BIGHOME directory may also be inaccessible after you leave. Pl arrange to take a backup of all your files well before the actual expiry date. "
1794,"   Important: The Institute reserves the right to modify this policy in any manner it deems necessary, at any time.  #####  LDAP Login Creation Policy for Sysads  ![](/assets/icons/Plus.svg)  **LDAP Login Creation Policy for Sysads** "
1795,   1\. Sysads must create an account for a new user after he/she has been issued an Identity Card from the Institute. Please note that the creation of Accounts for all categories of students are handled by ASC/CC. 
1796,"2\. For all faculty/staff/project staff accounts, please ensure that all the fields are filled with the correct information. Name, Employee Number, Expiry Date must be carefully filled up. For people staying inside IITB Campus the Residential Address (i.e. the fields QuarterType and RoomNumber) will be automatically picked up from the database maintained at Estate Office. For people staying out of campus, such information may be filled up properly. Please note that LDAP data is the institute directory and is useful in locating a user in emergency situations. "
1797,"Of these, the following will be locked once the account is activated:    * Employee Number   * Name   * Department   * Category   * Expiry Date  Userid will be initially assigned by the system. The users can change this to something of their choice (at a later date) only once. "
1798,"Due to the IT laws and the IITB IT policy in force, mandatory fields must be filled correctly for legal reasons. Accounts with missing information will not be activated by CC. "
1799,"3\. No micsellaneous category LDAP accounts can be created for students/staff or faculty under the LDAP. Misc accounts are meant purely for temporary and short periods, for special purposes (eg conferences, institute committees). All such accounts will be created at CC only after obtaining the necessary permission from Head, CC. Sysads/Department Heads may please forward such requests in writing or by email to Head, CC. It is recommended that special accounts for visitors, pre-admission students, and in general, for people who do not hold IITB Identity cards, be made on department intranet servers, rather than requesting LDAP accounts on the IITB LDAP server. "
1800,4\. Sysad may please advise the users staying outside the IITB Campus to update the LDAP records with their latest contact information. This is optional but highly recommended. It is useful have correct address of users so that they can be reached in an emergency.

1830,"   For any further questions please write to bitsnbytes[at]iitb.ac.in  #### Mirroring Distributions on FTP Server of IIT Bombay     Only “MAJOR” distributions of UNIX like distributions such as Linux, BSD, or Solaris will be considered as candidates for mirroring on the anonymous FTP server of IITB. A distribution will be considered as a candidate for mirroring and maintaining (i.e. “MAJOR”) on IITB's main FTP server if and only if there is a sizable base of users in IITB community wanting to use a particular distribution actively on a regular basis in their offices/labs. Accordingly, the following distributions are currently deemed “MAJOR” and hence are mirrored on IIT Bombay's FTP Server: "
1831,"  * CentOs Debian Fedora FreeBSD   * Gentoo Knoppix Mandriva OpenSuse   * ScientificLinux Slackware Ubuntu  The usage pattern of the mirrored distributions will be monitored. If need be, “MAJOR” status of distributions may be withdrawn and mirroring activity for such distributions may be stopped. Head CC may be approached with proposals to consider mirroring new distributions only after forming a core interest group for the concerned distribution. "
1832,"The Institute reserves the right to modify this policy in any manner it deems necessary, at any time.  #### Group Email Policy     From time to time, Computer Centre (CC) receives requests to post contents targeted towards specific user groups or even all users. This document tries to formally describe all the GROUP EMAILING mechanisms available in IITB. In this context, the notion of the “ALL” users need some explaining. In IITB we have centralized LDAP-based Email accounts. For such accounts, it is possible to do an exhaustive search over all accounts registered in the directory based on some criteria (or simply choose all from the directory) and then target an email to that selected set of users. "
1833,"However, it is observed that there are sizable number of users who donot access LDAP based Email facilities and may even be unaware of its existence. Under such circumstances, it is meaningless to perform GROUP emailing to such accounts. In IITB, individual departments have their own email servers and may sometimes have created aliases to address “ALL” users in their respective departments. However, it is not clear as to which departments support this and who all are included in such aliases. "
1834,"Under these circumstances, it is only meaningful to send such GROUP emails to HOSTEL/DEPARTMENT SYSTEM ADMINISTRATORS and leave it upto them as to how they propagate that information to individual users. "
1835,"In addition, there are different mailing lists in operation for information dissemination among the IITB community. Many of the mailing lists are formed by special interest groups and as a result the participation in such lists is voluntary in nature.

1852,"4\. Call at 7751. This is the least preferred method. **Only network related complaints will be accepted on the phone**. Even though we try to make this a 24 hour call number, we do not have dedicated staff for this. So you might miss us on the phone! Also, in this case we have to manually log your complaint. When you do report the problem please do not expect a solution on the phone (the person who is taking your call cannot give you technical suggestions), so please be brief. "
1853,   **What should you expect and how fast:**  We promise to send you a reply within a few hours of your registering your complaint. This may not be possible on weekends and holidays though we are trying to improve the situation. 
1854,"Depending on the nature of the complaint, you should normally expect that it will be resolved within 24 hours. In any case, we will let you know if we cannot solve the problem (lack of jurisdiction, expertise) or when we will be able to sort it out if the period is likely to be longer than 24 hours (excluding the weekend!). "
1855,"If you do not get a reply within 24 hours send a mail to: head.cc[AT]iitb.ac.in with the subject containing the word ""COMPLAINT"" (without the quotes).  #### Network Policy     #####  Resnet Policy  ![](/assets/icons/Plus.svg) "
1856,**Resnet Policy**     1.Computer centre is responsible for the residential network of IITB.  2.computer centre is responsible for providing connection up to your building's switch.  3.Connectivity from building switch up to the user wall jack will be maintain by CC. 
1857,"4.Only One connection will be provided per house by CC and only upto the hall of the house.  5.The necessary IP Address,mask,gateway,DNS etc will be provide by CC, but all the details need to be entered by the user into the network settings of their computer. "
1858,"Note: The network configuration details can be found by clicking at the link below.  [Resnet IP Allocation Scheme.](/page/ip_residence)  6.please ensure that the settings of the browser are correct and also verify the network configuration of your computer. To verify the network configuration ie IP address, Gateway, Subnet mask, and DNS "
1859,7.After ensuring that your network configuration is correct then please ping the given IP addresses (Hop-1 Hop-2) from the link below.  [Resnet Hop List.](/page/ip_residence)  8.If the problem is not resolved after following instruction 6 please perform the basic connectivity test as follow:- 
1860,"  1. Check whether the utp cable is plugged properly.   2. Check whether the green light (shown below) is blinking on the back panel of CPU.   3. If No then ---- Change utp cable and try again, if it is still not working, please report to CC "
1861,"![](/attachments/resnetpolicy/LANLight.jpg)      9\. If your computer generates unusual amount of traffic and leads to degradation of network performence or disrupts services, CC will notify the concerned resident and disconnect the computer from the network untill the problem is fixed satisfactorily. "
1862,#####  WIFI Use Policy For Resnet  ![](/assets/icons/Plus.svg)  **WiFi Use Policy for Resnet**     As you are aware CC has recently implemented a policy of registering and binding your residential computer's network hardware address to the IP number that your computer uses. We emphasize that this measure is to ensure that no one abuses your residential network resources. 
1863,"In this connection, it is seen that many residents are using mis-configured Wireless Access Points/Wireless Routers at home. Wireless Access Points have to be configured very carefully in order to prevent people in your neighborhood and possible rogue users from using the network addresses and resources alloted to you. "
1864,"Hence, the following policy must be adhered to in order to prevent misuse and implement proper network security:    1. DHCP servers have to be disabled on all Residential machines and Wireless Access Points/Wireless Routers. This means that you will have to provide static IPs to every computer at home, and not let the DHCP server provide the IP automatically. If a DHCP server is running, it generates broadcast over the entire network, announcing to other users its presence and allocates your range of IP addresses to potential trespassers. Such users will be able to use your wireless equipment to connect to the institute network and any possible misuse will be attributed to you.   2. Access control lists have to be configured on the Wireless Access Points/Wireless Routers to allow only specific set of mac addresses to be able to use your wireless equipment. This will allow only your own machines to use the WiFi equipment. Wireless access points have a access range of 100 m, and anybody in that range will be able to connect via your access point. Hence, it is essential to configure Access Control (User mac address filters) on the wireless devices. "
1865,**Please ask the appropriate vendor to configure your wireless access points/wireless routers at the time of installation. The above features may also be implemented on wifi equipment already deployed in the residential network.** 
1866,WiFi hardware of various makes/brands has been deployed in resnet. It is not feasible for CC to provide any hardware assistance in this matter.  Access points not configured properly will not be able to connect to the Institute network. 
1867,"In view of the IT laws in force, that require users to take responsibility for their own network use, we are constrained to implement these features on the IITB network.  #####  Hostel Area Network Policy  ![](/assets/icons/Plus.svg) "
1868,**Hostel Area Network Policy**     1\. All linux machines shall be allowed to access the internet directly through netmon/ appropriate CC server.  2\. Windows machines are not allowed to access the internet directly. 
1869,"3\. Windows machines have to ""tunnel"" through specified proxy server(s), located in the hostel computer room, on which FTP, SSH and X-serving have been set up. This set up will be monitored for performance. As many services as can be set up with the available expertise will be made accessible. Decisions regarding upgrading or stoppage of services on these servers will be taken by hostel-sysads+mlc+cc. Experiments on how to get the best out of this option may be taken by some of the hostel sysads with the help of expertise available within the student/hostel community. "
1870,"4\. No special cases will be allowed access network via Windows to outside of the Hostel Network. If a very strong reason exists for an individual to demand such access he/she will make an application to their hostel sysad who will forward with comments to the mlc, which in turn will forward it, with their remarks, to CC for consideration. "
1871,"5\. Windows users should generally be urged to keep their machines clean, updated and patched as they can still cause infections and disruptions to their fellow residents on the intranet.  6\. A penalty system will be implemented, in case a hostel computer is found directly accessing internet through Windows. The following penalty procedure shall be followed: "
1872,First Time- Warning shall be issued.   Second Time- One Week network disconnected.   Third Time- One Semester network disconnected.   Fourth Time- Entire Stay without network.  Hostel Sysads will be mailed a list of defaulters IPs regularly by the mlc/cc. They are supposed to enforce appropriate action. 
1873,"7\. All disputes between mlc and individual sysads (eg not implementing stated policies) will be brought to the notice of Head, CC immediately, for resolution.  8\. All these policies will be put on the MLC Homepage. Any significant point or remark made by the ""general body"" should be brought to the notice of this mailing list. "
1874,"#####  Academic Area Network Policy  ![](/assets/icons/Plus.svg)  **Academic Area Network Policy**     1\. Computer centre (CC) is responsible for the core IIT-B Network (includes internet facilities: email, web etc).  2\. CC will provide connectivity to each Department, to the gigabit backbone, and also the necessary IP addresses, proxies, email relays etc. "
1875,"3\. The operation of the network within each Department is the sole responsibility of the Department (Head & Sysads) CC will only play an advisory role.  4\. If a Department network “misbehaves” and causes problems for any other department or the entire campus, or disrupts services, CC will notify the concerned Head & Sysad and disconnect the Department from the core network until the problem is fixed satisfactorily. "
1876,"5\. To minimize the problem of disconnection, Departments will separate their network into 2 sub-networks (one for Windows and one for Linux/Unix). This will allow CC to turn off only the offending subnet in case of virus/worm attacks. "
1877,"6\. Use of pirated/illegal software is not acceptable. It is the responsibility of the Departments (Heads & Sysads) to ensure compliance.  #### Policy for Usage of Discuss Faculty Mailing List     **Purpose:** The “discuss-faculty” email list is primarily for discussion on academic, research, IITB Campus matters and socio-cultural issues of common interest to IITB faculty members. "
1878,"**Etiquette:** Discussions must be kept civil at all times, maintaining respect for individuals and groups even if there is difference of opinion. Specifically, the list can not be used for content which is offensive or abusive to any specific person or group based on gender, caste, religion, race, nationality, place of origin, personal background, age, disability, disease, etc. Users should not promote violence or make threats under any circumstance. "
1879,**Non-Commercial Use:** The list should be used only for non-commercial purposes.  **Legal Use:** The list cannot be used for anything illegal as per the applicable laws of India. Further all postings must conform to the Conduct Rules as laid down in the Statutes of the Institute. 
1880,"**Overseeing Committee:** The above terms of use will be enforced by an Overseeing Committee, to whom any violation of can be reported. Note that the “enforcement” will not be on a day-to-day pro-active basis through “moderation”. Discuss-faculty will remain an unmoderated list. The role of the overseeing committee is relevant only as a committee to which abuses are reported, and which adjudicates such complaints. For each report, the Committee has the authority and responsibility to decide whether and what action is to be taken, related to the membership of the concerned user(s) in the email list. Such action may include debarring the concerned user(s) for any limited or unlimited period of time. Further, the Committee shall have the authority to forward any reported abuse to the Institute authorities, if it so deems fit, for redressal as per due process laid down under the statutes and rules of the Institute. Further, regardless of the actions of the overseeing committee, an aggrieved member can independently approach the Institute for redressal. "
1881,**Committee Membership:** The Overseeing Committee also has the authority and responsibility to nominate any other responsible member of the campus community to replace them. Committee members should preferably be users of the list. At any time there should be at least one woman member in the committee. The nominal length of term of a committee member shall be 1 year. New members of the committee will be selected by Deputy Director (AIA) in consultation with existing members of the committee.
